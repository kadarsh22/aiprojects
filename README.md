This is a compilation of many projects that I did when I started learning Deep Learning.

Most of them are either **outdated, broken or written in tensorflow** - all of which are bad.
Nonetheless, I hope this repo will be useful in some way.

Note that some projects failed and/or did not produce intended results.

I intend to rework most of these into polished, stand alone, high quality repos.

1. [Applications](Applications) - Interesting applications of deep learning models.
2. [Research-Papers](Research-Papers) - Implementations of research papers.
3. [Experiments](Experiments) - Experimenting with different ideas.
4. [Exploration](Exploration) - Exploring deep learning concepts.
5. [Kaggle](Kaggle) - Projects made for Kaggle competitions.

_Note: If you get an import error, it's usually because of some functionality that I've written in a seperate module, [vaipy](https://github.com/svaisakh/_archived_vai).
Since [vaipy](https://github.com/svaisakh/_archived_vai) has changed enormously since the start of these projects,
you can search the archived version of the [repo](https://github.com/svaisakh/_archived_vai) for the desired functionality. Any pull-requests in this regard are always welcome._
