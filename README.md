This is a compilation of many projects that I did when I started learning Deep Learning.

Most of them are either **outdated, broken or written in tensorflow** - all of which are bad.
Nonetheless, I hope this repo will be useful in some way.

Note that some projects failed and/or did not produce intended results.

I intend to rework most of these into polished, stand alone, high quality repos.

1. [Applications](Applications) - Interesting applications of deep learning models.
2. [Research-Papers](Research-Papers) - Implementations of research papers.
3. [Experiments](Experiments) - Experimenting with different ideas.
4. [Exploration](Exploration) - Exploring deep learning concepts.
5. [Kaggle](Kaggle) - Projects made for Kaggle competitions.
