This is a compilation of many projects that I did when I started learning Deep Learning.

Most of them are either outdated, broken or written in tensorflow - all of which are bad.

I intend to rework most of these into polished, stand alone, high quality repos.

You can follow my progress on Trello:
1. Under Review - (https://trello.com/b/mDzSrxam/ml-projectsreviewing)
2. In the pipeline - (https://trello.com/b/ErqwjhoC/ml-projects)
3. Unsuccessful - (https://trello.com/b/IFX6ZVfj/ml-projects-undone)
