# Reinforcement Learning Explorations

These notebooks were created as a first look into reinforcement learning.

Note that they do not involve sufficiently complex approaches such as Q-Learning or A3C but simpler to implement ones like evolution.

## Notebooks

1.RandSearch - Random search in the parameter space.

2.Evolution - Utilizing Evolutionary Strategies

3.ConvPolicy - What would happen if an agent were to output a mult-step policy? This exploration tries to answer this using CNNs.
