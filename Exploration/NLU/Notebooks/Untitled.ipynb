I GO TO STYLES\\n\\nThe intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time\\nas \"The Styles Case\" has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in view of\\nthe world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both by\\nmy friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account of the\\nwhole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensational\\nrumours which still persist.\\n\\nI will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\\nbeing connected with the affair.\\n\\nI had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some\\nmonths in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month\\'s\\nsick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make\\nup my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen very\\nlittle of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him particularly\\nwell. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one thing, though he\\nhardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though, I had often stayed\\nat Styles, his mother\\'s place in Essex.\\n\\nWe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me down\\nto Styles to spend my leave there.\\n\\n\"The mater will be delighted to see you again--after all those years,\"\\nhe added.\\n\\n\"Your mother keeps well?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?\"\\n\\nI am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who had\\nmarried John\\'s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been a\\nhandsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could\\nnot be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,\\nautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\\nnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady\\nBountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\\nfortune of her own.\\n\\nTheir country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish\\nearly in their married life. He had been completely under his wife\\'s\\nascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\\nlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had\\nalways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\\ntime of their father\\'s remarriage that they always thought of her as\\ntheir own mother.\\n\\nLawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a\\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\\nmarked success.\\n\\nJohn practiced for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married\\ntwo years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I\\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\\nto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\\nof his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\\nown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\\ncase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\\n\\nJohn noticed my surprise at the news of his mother\\'s remarriage and\\nsmiled rather ruefully.\\n\\n\"Rotten little bounder too!\" he said savagely. \"I can tell you,\\nHastings, it\\'s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie--you\\nremember Evie?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She\\'s the mater\\'s factotum,\\ncompanion, Jack of all trades! A great sport--old Evie! Not precisely\\nyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.\"\\n\\n\"You were going to say----?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being\\na second cousin or something of Evie\\'s, though she didn\\'t seem\\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an\\nabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. He\\'s got a great black beard,\\nand wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned\\nto him at once, took him on as secretary--you know how she\\'s always\\nrunning a hundred societies?\"\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n\"Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No\\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us\\nall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\\nthat she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty\\nyears younger than she is! It\\'s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\\nthere you are--she is her own mistress, and she\\'s married him.\"\\n\\n\"It must be a difficult situation for you all.\"\\n\\n\"Difficult! It\\'s damnable!\"\\n\\nThus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train at\\nStyles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason for\\nexistence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes.\\nJohn Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out to the\\ncar.\\n\\n\"Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,\" he remarked. \"Mainly owing\\nto the mater\\'s activities.\"\\n\\nThe village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the\\nlittle station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It was\\na still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat Essex\\ncountry, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it seemed\\nalmost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great war was\\nrunning its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed into another\\nworld. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid you\\'ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.\"\\n\\n\"My dear fellow, that\\'s just what I want.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill\\nwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife\\nworks regularly \\'on the land\\'. She is up at five every morning to milk,\\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It\\'s a jolly good life taking\\nit all round--if it weren\\'t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!\" He\\nchecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. \"I wonder if we\\'ve\\ntime to pick up Cynthia. No, she\\'ll have started from the hospital by\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"Cynthia! That\\'s not your wife?\"\\n\\n\"No, Cynthia is a protegee of my mother\\'s, the daughter of an old\\nschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a\\ncropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came\\nto the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She\\nworks in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\\nA lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\\nstraightened herself at our approach.\\n\\n\"Hullo, Evie, here\\'s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings--Miss Howard.\"\\n\\nMiss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had\\nan impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a\\npleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\\nin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with feet\\nto match--these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation, I\\nsoon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\\n\\n\"Weeds grow like house afire. Can\\'t keep even with \\'em. Shall press you\\nin. Better be careful.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,\" I\\nresponded.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say it. Never does. Wish you hadn\\'t later.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re a cynic, Evie,\" said John, laughing. \"Where\\'s tea to-day--inside\\nor out?\"\\n\\n\"Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.\"\\n\\n\"Come on then, you\\'ve done enough gardening for to-day. \\'The labourer is\\nworthy of his hire\\', you know. Come and be refreshed.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, \"I\\'m\\ninclined to agree with you.\"\\n\\nShe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\\nof a large sycamore.\\n\\nA figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\\nmeet us.\\n\\n\"My wife, Hastings,\" said John.\\n\\nI shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall, slender\\nform, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of slumbering\\nfire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes\\nof hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman\\'s that I\\nhave ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed, which\\nnevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an\\nexquisitely civilised body--all these things are burnt into my memory. I\\nshall never forget them.\\n\\nShe greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\\nvoice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had\\naccepted John\\'s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and her\\nfew quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly\\nfascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always stimulating, and\\nI described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents of my Convalescent\\nHome, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly amused my hostess. John,\\nof course, good fellow though he is, could hardly be called a brilliant\\nconversationalist.\\n\\nAt that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French\\nwindow near at hand:\\n\\n\"Then you\\'ll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I\\'ll write to Lady\\nTadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we hear\\nfrom the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might open\\nit the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there\\'s the\\nDuchess--about the school fete.\"\\n\\nThere was the murmur of a man\\'s voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s rose\\nin reply:\\n\\n\"Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,\\nAlfred dear.\"\\n\\nThe French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome white-haired\\nold lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features, stepped out of\\nit on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of deference in his\\nmanner.\\n\\nMrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\\n\\n\"Why, if it isn\\'t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after\\nall these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings--my husband.\"\\n\\nI looked with some curiosity at \"Alfred darling\". He certainly struck a\\nrather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard.\\nIt was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore\\ngold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It\\nstruck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\\nof place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He placed\\na wooden hand in mine and said:\\n\\n\"This is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.\" Then, turning to his wife: \"Emily\\ndearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.\"\\n\\nShe beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\\ndemonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an otherwise\\nsensible woman!\\n\\nWith the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\\nhostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in\\nparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,\\nhowever, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I\\nremembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\\npoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\\nshortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\\ndays or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the\\nvery first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter myself\\nthat my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\\n\\nPresently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about letters\\nto Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice:\\n\\n\"Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?\"\\n\\n\"No, before the war I was in Lloyd\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"And you will return there after it is over?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.\"\\n\\nMary Cavendish leant forward.\\n\\n\"What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just consult\\nyour inclination?\"\\n\\n\"Well, that depends.\"\\n\\n\"No secret hobby?\" she asked. \"Tell me--you\\'re drawn to something? Every\\none is--usually something absurd.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll laugh at me.\"\\n\\nShe smiled.\\n\\n\"Perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!\"\\n\\n\"The real thing--Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully\\ndrawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous\\ndetective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.\\nHe used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method.\\nMy system is based on his--though of course I have progressed rather\\nfurther. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but wonderfully\\nclever.\"\\n\\n\"Like a good detective story myself,\" remarked Miss Howard. \"Lots of\\nnonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Every one\\ndumbfounded. Real crime--you\\'d know at once.\"\\n\\n\"There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,\" I argued.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The family.\\nYou couldn\\'t really hoodwink them. They\\'d know.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" I said, much amused, \"you think that if you were mixed up in a\\ncrime, say a murder, you\\'d be able to spot the murderer right off?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I should. Mightn\\'t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\\nBut I\\'m certain I\\'d know. I\\'d feel it in my fingertips if he came near\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"It might be a \\'she,\\'\" I suggested.\\n\\n\"Might. But murder\\'s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.\"\\n\\n\"Not in a case of poisoning.\" Mrs. Cavendish\\'s clear voice startled\\nme. \"Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!\" cried Mrs. Inglethorp. \"It\\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there\\'s\\nCynthia!\"\\n\\nA young girl in V. A. D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\\n\\n\"Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings--Miss Murdoch.\"\\n\\nCynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\\nvigour. She tossed off her little V. A. D. cap, and I admired the great\\nloose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\\nhand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she\\nwould have been a beauty.\\n\\nShe flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a\\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\\n\\n\"Sit down here on the grass, do. It\\'s ever so much nicer.\"\\n\\nI dropped down obediently.\\n\\n\"You work at Tadminster, don\\'t you, Miss Murdoch?\"\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n\"For my sins.\"\\n\\n\"Do they bully you, then?\" I asked, smiling.\\n\\n\"I should like to see them!\" cried Cynthia with dignity.\\n\\n\"I have got a cousin who is nursing,\" I remarked. \"And she is terrified\\nof \\'Sisters\\'.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp--ly\\n_are_! You\\'ve no idea! But I\\'m not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the\\ndispensary.\"\\n\\n\"How many people do you poison?\" I asked, smiling.\\n\\nCynthia smiled too.\\n\\n\"Oh, hundreds!\" she said.\\n\\n\"Cynthia,\" called Mrs. Inglethorp, \"do you think you could write a few\\nnotes for me?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, Aunt Emily.\"\\n\\nShe jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\\nher position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she\\nmight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\\n\\nMy hostess turned to me.\\n\\n\"John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have\\ngiven up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member\\'s\\nwife--she was the late Lord Abbotsbury\\'s daughter--does the same. She\\nagrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a\\nwar household; nothing is wasted here--every scrap of waste paper, even,\\nis saved and sent away in sacks.\"\\n\\nI expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the\\nbroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different wings\\nof the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out over the\\npark.\\n\\nJohn left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking\\nslowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.\\nInglethorp call \"Cynthia\" impatiently, and the girl started and ran back\\nto the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the shadow of\\na tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked about forty,\\nvery dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some violent emotion\\nseemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window as he passed, and\\nI recognized him, though he had changed much in the fifteen years that\\nhad elapsed since we last met. It was John\\'s younger brother, Lawrence\\nCavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought that singular\\nexpression to his face.\\n\\nThen I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\\nmy own affairs.\\n\\nThe evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that\\nenigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.\\n\\nThe next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the\\nanticipation of a delightful visit.\\n\\nI did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\\ntake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\\nwoods, returning to the house about five.\\n\\nAs we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the\\nsmoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\\noccurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.\\n\\n\"Look here, Mary, there\\'s the deuce of a mess. Evie\\'s had a row with\\nAlfred Inglethorp, and she\\'s off.\"\\n\\n\"Evie? Off?\"\\n\\nJohn nodded gloomily.\\n\\n\"Yes; you see she went to the mater, and--Oh, here\\'s Evie herself.\"\\n\\nMiss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\\na small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on\\nthe defensive.\\n\\n\"At any rate,\" she burst out, \"I\\'ve spoken my mind!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Evelyn,\" cried Mrs. Cavendish, \"this can\\'t be true!\"\\n\\nMiss Howard nodded grimly.\\n\\n\"True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won\\'t forget or\\nforgive in a hurry. Don\\'t mind if they\\'ve only sunk in a bit. Probably\\nwater off a duck\\'s back, though. I said right out: \\'You\\'re an old woman,\\nEmily, and there\\'s no fool like an old fool. The man\\'s twenty years\\nyounger than you, and don\\'t you fool yourself as to what he married you\\nfor. Money! Well, don\\'t let him have too much of it. Farmer Raikes has\\ngot a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much time he\\nspends over there.\\' She was very angry. Natural! I went on, \\'I\\'m going\\nto warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as soon murder\\nyou in your bed as look at you. He\\'s a bad lot. You can say what you\\nlike to me, but remember what I\\'ve told you. He\\'s a bad lot!\\'\"\\n\\n\"What did she say?\"\\n\\nMiss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.\\n\\n\"\\'Darling Alfred\\'--\\'dearest Alfred\\'--\\'wicked calumnies\\'--\\'wicked\\nlies\\'--\\'wicked woman\\'--to accuse her \\'dear husband\\'! The sooner I left\\nher house the better. So I\\'m off.\"\\n\\n\"But not now?\"\\n\\n\"This minute!\"\\n\\nFor a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, finding\\nhis persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife\\nfollowed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to\\nthink better of it.\\n\\nAs she left the room, Miss Howard\\'s face changed. She leant towards me\\neagerly.\\n\\n\"Mr. Hastings, you\\'re honest. I can trust you?\"\\n\\nI was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her voice\\nto a whisper.\\n\\n\"Look after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They\\'re a lot of\\nsharks--all of them. Oh, I know what I\\'m talking about. There isn\\'t\\none of them that\\'s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I\\'ve\\nprotected her as much as I could. Now I\\'m out of the way, they\\'ll impose\\nupon her.\"\\n\\n\"Of course, Miss Howard,\" I said, \"I\\'ll do everything I can, but I\\'m\\nsure you\\'re excited and overwrought.\"\\n\\nShe interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.\\n\\n\"Young man, trust me. I\\'ve lived in the world rather longer than you\\nhave. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You\\'ll see what I mean.\"\\n\\nThe throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard\\nrose and moved to the door. John\\'s voice sounded outside. With her hand\\non the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to\\nme.\\n\\n\"Above all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil--her husband!\"\\n\\nThere was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager\\nchorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.\\n\\nAs the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from\\nthe group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall bearded\\nman who had been evidently making for the house. The colour rose in her\\ncheeks as she held out her hand to him.\\n\\n\"Who is that?\" I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.\\n\\n\"That\\'s Dr. Bauerstein,\" said John shortly.\\n\\n\"And who is Dr. Bauerstein?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous\\nbreakdown. He\\'s a London specialist; a very clever man--one of the\\ngreatest living experts on poisons, I believe.\"\\n\\n\"And he\\'s a great friend of Mary\\'s,\" put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.\\n\\nJohn Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.\\n\\n\"Come for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She\\nalways had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England\\nthan Evelyn Howard.\"\\n\\nHe took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the\\nvillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.\\n\\nAs we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty\\nyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\\nsmiled.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a pretty girl,\" I remarked appreciatively.\\n\\nJohn\\'s face hardened.\\n\\n\"That is Mrs. Raikes.\"\\n\\n\"The one that Miss Howard----\"\\n\\n\"Exactly,\" said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.\\n\\nI thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid\\nwicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of\\nforeboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.\\n\\n\"Styles is really a glorious old place,\" I said to John.\\n\\nHe nodded rather gloomily.\\n\\n\"Yes, it\\'s a fine property. It\\'ll be mine some day--should be mine\\nnow by rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I\\nshouldn\\'t be so damned hard up as I am now.\"\\n\\n\"Hard up, are you?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Hastings, I don\\'t mind telling you that I\\'m at my wits\\' end for\\nmoney.\"\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t your brother help you?\"\\n\\n\"Lawrence? He\\'s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten\\nverses in fancy bindings. No, we\\'re an impecunious lot. My mother\\'s\\nalways been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since\\nher marriage, of course----\" he broke off, frowning.\\n\\nFor the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something\\nindefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt\\nsecurity. Now that security was removed--and the air seemed rife\\nwith suspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me\\nunpleasantly. A vague suspicion of every one and everything filled my\\nmind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. THE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY\\n\\nI had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events\\nof the 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader\\nI will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\\npossible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\\nlong and tedious cross-examinations.\\n\\nI received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her\\ndeparture, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\\nMiddlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging\\nme to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be\\nreconciled.\\n\\nThe only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish\\'s\\nextraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the\\nsociety of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine, but\\nshe was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for long\\nexpeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to see his\\nattraction.\\n\\nThe 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous\\nbazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection\\nwith the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War\\npoem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning\\narranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take\\nplace. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\\ngarden. I noticed that John\\'s manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed\\nvery excited and restless.\\n\\nAfter tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\\nin the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.\\n\\nAbout a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be\\nlate as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get\\nready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at the\\ndoor.\\n\\nThe entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s recitation\\nreceiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which\\nCynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a\\nsupper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been\\nacting with her in the tableaux.\\n\\nThe following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as\\nshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about\\n12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.\\n\\n\"Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster\\'s\\nsister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror--one of\\nour oldest families.\"\\n\\nMary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.\\nBauerstein.\\n\\nWe had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested that\\nwe should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our way,\\nand pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp replied\\nthat this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters to write\\nshe would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia in the\\npony-trap.\\n\\nWe were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia\\nappeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white\\noverall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow\\ndispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily\\naddressed as \"Nibs.\"\\n\\n\"What a lot of bottles!\" I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the\\nsmall room. \"Do you really know what\\'s in them all?\"\\n\\n\"Say something original,\" groaned Cynthia. \"Every single person who\\ncomes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\\nthe first individual who does _not_ say: \\'What a lot of bottles!\\' And\\nI know the next thing you\\'re going to say is: \\'How many people have you\\npoisoned?\\'\"\\n\\nI pleaded guilty with a laugh.\\n\\n\"If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\\nmistake, you wouldn\\'t joke about it. Come on, let\\'s have tea. We\\'ve got\\nall sorts of secret stories in that cupboard. No, Lawrence--that\\'s the\\npoison cupboard. The big cupboard--that\\'s right.\"\\n\\nWe had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards. We\\nhad just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door. The\\ncountenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a stern\\nand forbidding expression.\\n\\n\"Come in,\" said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.\\n\\nA young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\\nshe proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat\\nenigmatical remark:\\n\\n\"_I_\\'m not really here to-day.\"\\n\\nCynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.\\n\\n\"This should have been sent up this morning.\"\\n\\n\"Sister is very sorry. She forgot.\"\\n\\n\"Sister should read the rules outside the door.\"\\n\\nI gathered from the little nurse\\'s expression that there was not the\\nleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\\nthe dreaded \"Sister\".\\n\\n\"So now it can\\'t be done until to-morrow,\" finished Cynthia.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Cynthia graciously, \"we are very busy, but if we have time\\nit shall be done.\"\\n\\nThe little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the\\nshelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the door.\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n\"Discipline must be maintained?\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside\\nwards there.\"\\n\\nI followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\\nwards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia\\ncalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at\\nher watch.\\n\\n\"Nothing more to do, Nibs?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"All right. Then we can lock up and go.\"\\n\\nI had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared\\nto John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was\\nthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually shy\\nand reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied that,\\nif one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for him.\\nI had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather constrained,\\nand that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him. But they were\\nboth gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like a couple of\\nchildren.\\n\\nAs we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some stamps,\\nso accordingly we pulled up at the post office.\\n\\nAs I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just entering.\\nI drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud exclamation, he\\nclasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.\\n\\n\"_Mon ami_ Hastings!\" he cried. \"It is indeed _mon ami_ Hastings!\"\\n\\n\"Poirot!\" I exclaimed.\\n\\nI turned to the pony-trap.\\n\\n\"This is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old\\nfriend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, we know Monsieur Poirot,\" said Cynthia gaily. \"But I had no idea he\\nwas a friend of yours.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Poirot seriously. \"I know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It\\nis by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.\" Then,\\nas I looked at him inquiringly: \"Yes, my friend, she had kindly extended\\nhospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are refugees from\\ntheir native land. We Belgians will always remember her with gratitude.\"\\n\\nPoirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than\\nfive feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His head\\nwas exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on\\none side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of\\nhis attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have\\ncaused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified\\nlittle man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his\\ntime one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As\\na detective, his flair had been extraordinary, and he had achieved\\ntriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\\n\\nHe pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\\nBelgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he\\nraised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.\\n\\n\"He\\'s a dear little man,\" said Cynthia. \"I\\'d no idea you knew him.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,\" I replied.\\n\\nAnd, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various\\nexploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.\\n\\nWe arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.\\nInglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s you,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Is there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?\" asked Cynthia.\\n\\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. \"What should there\\nbe?\" Then catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the\\ndining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.\\n\\n\"Yes, m\\'m.\" The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: \"Don\\'t\\nyou think, m\\'m, you\\'d better get to bed? You\\'re looking very tired.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you\\'re right, Dorcas--yes--no--not now. I\\'ve some letters I\\nmust finish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, m\\'m.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll go to bed directly after supper.\"\\n\\nShe went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.\\n\\n\"Goodness gracious! I wonder what\\'s up?\" she said to Lawrence.\\n\\nHe did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his\\nheel and went out of the house.\\n\\nI suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,\\nI ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.\\n\\nMrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,\\nbut she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.\\n\\n\"Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?\" I asked, trying to appear as\\nindifferent as I could.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t go,\" she replied abruptly. \"Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?\"\\n\\n\"In the boudoir.\"\\n\\nHer hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve\\nherself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs\\nacross the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.\\n\\nAs I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the\\nopen boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following\\nscrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\\ndesperately controlling herself:\\n\\n\"Then you won\\'t show it to me?\"\\n\\nTo which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:\\n\\n\"My dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.\"\\n\\n\"Then show it to me.\"\\n\\n\"I tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the\\nleast.\"\\n\\nTo which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:\\n\\n\"Of course, I might have known you would shield him.\"\\n\\nCynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:\\n\\n\"I say! There\\'s been the most awful row! I\\'ve got it all out of Dorcas.\"\\n\\n\"What kind of a row?\"\\n\\n\"Between Aunt Emily and _him_. I do hope she\\'s found him out at last!\"\\n\\n\"Was Dorcas there, then?\"\\n\\n\"Of course not. She \\'happened to be near the door\\'. It was a real old\\nbust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.\"\\n\\nI thought of Mrs. Raikes\\'s gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard\\'s warnings, but\\nwisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every possible\\nhypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, \"Aunt Emily will send him away, and\\nwill never speak to him again.\"\\n\\nI was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.\\nEvidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried\\nto forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could\\nnot dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish\\'s\\nconcern in the matter?\\n\\nMr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His\\nface was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck\\nme afresh.\\n\\nMrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during\\nthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was\\nunusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little\\nattentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the\\npart of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp\\nretired to her boudoir again.\\n\\n\"Send my coffee in here, Mary,\" she called. \"I\\'ve just five minutes to\\ncatch the post.\"\\n\\nCynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary\\nCavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.\\n\\n\"Do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?\" she\\nasked. \"Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour\\nit out.\"\\n\\n\"Do not trouble, Mary,\" said Inglethorp. \"I will take it to Emily.\" He\\npoured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.\\n\\nLawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.\\n\\nWe three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and\\nstill. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.\\n\\n\"It\\'s almost too hot,\" she murmured. \"We shall have a thunderstorm.\"\\n\\nAlas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was\\nrudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,\\nvoice in the hall.\\n\\n\"Dr. Bauerstein!\" exclaimed Cynthia. \"What a funny time to come.\"\\n\\nI glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite undisturbed,\\nthe delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.\\n\\nIn a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the\\nlatter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\\ndrawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally\\nplastered with mud.\\n\\n\"What have you been doing, doctor?\" cried Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\n\"I must make my apologies,\" said the doctor. \"I did not really mean to\\ncome in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,\" said John, strolling in from\\nthe hall. \"Have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, I will.\" He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he\\nhad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,\\nand in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped\\nignominiously into a neighbouring pond.\\n\\n\"The sun soon dried me off,\" he added, \"but I\\'m afraid my appearance is\\nvery disreputable.\"\\n\\nAt this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and\\nthe girl ran out.\\n\\n\"Just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I\\'m going to bed.\"\\n\\nThe door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,\\nJohn was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could\\nswear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in\\nher hand.\\n\\nMy evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.\\nBauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last,\\nhowever, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll walk down to the village with you,\" said Mr. Inglethorp. \"I must\\nsee our agent over those estate accounts.\" He turned to John. \"No one\\nneed sit up. I will take the latch-key.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY\\n\\nTo make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the\\nfirst floor of Styles. The servants\\' rooms are reached through the\\ndoor B. They have no communication with the right wing, where the\\nInglethorps\\' rooms were situated.\\n\\n\\nIt seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence\\nCavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face\\ntold me at once that something was seriously wrong.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect\\nmy scattered thoughts.\\n\\n\"We are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind\\nof fit. Unfortunately she has locked herself in.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll come at once.\"\\n\\nI sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence\\nalong the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.\\n\\nJohn Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing\\nround in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his\\nbrother.\\n\\n\"What do you think we had better do?\"\\n\\nNever, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.\\n\\nJohn rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s door violently, but with\\nno effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole\\nhousehold was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible from\\nthe interior of the room. Clearly something must be done.\\n\\n\"Try going through Mr. Inglethorp\\'s room, sir,\" cried Dorcas. \"Oh, the\\npoor mistress!\"\\n\\nSuddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us--that he\\nalone had given no sign of his presence. John opened the door of his\\nroom. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle, and\\nby its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and that\\nthere was no sign of the room having been occupied.\\n\\nWe went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or bolted\\non the inside. What was to be done?\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, sir,\" cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, \"what ever shall we\\ndo?\"\\n\\n\"We must try and break the door in, I suppose. It\\'ll be a tough job,\\nthough. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him\\nto go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, we\\'ll have a try at the door.\\nHalf a moment, though, isn\\'t there a door into Miss Cynthia\\'s rooms?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, but that\\'s always bolted. It\\'s never been undone.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we might just see.\"\\n\\nHe ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia\\'s room. Mary Cavendish\\nwas there, shaking the girl--who must have been an unusually sound\\nsleeper--and trying to wake her.\\n\\nIn a moment or two he was back.\\n\\n\"No good. That\\'s bolted too. We must break in the door. I think this one\\nis a shade less solid than the one in the passage.\"\\n\\nWe strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid,\\nand for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it give\\nbeneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was burst\\nopen.\\n\\nWe stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs.\\nInglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent\\nconvulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\\nher. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon\\nthe pillows.\\n\\nJohn strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of\\nthe housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.\\nThen he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave\\non the corridor.\\n\\nI turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that\\nthere was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on\\nmy lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man\\'s face. He was\\nwhite as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was sputtering\\nonto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or some such\\nkindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on the further\\nwall. It was as though he had seen something that turned him to stone.\\nI instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I could see\\nnothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the grate, and the\\nrow of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely harmless enough.\\n\\nThe violence of Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s attack seemed to be passing. She was\\nable to speak in short gasps.\\n\\n\"Better now--very sudden--stupid of me--to lock myself in.\"\\n\\nA shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing\\nnear the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting\\nthe girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her face was\\nheavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.\\n\\n\"Poor Cynthia is quite frightened,\" said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear\\nvoice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock. Then\\nit must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of daylight\\nwas showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the clock on\\nthe mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o\\'clock.\\n\\nA strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized\\nthe unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible\\nto behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged round her, powerless to\\nhelp or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until she\\nappeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched in\\nan extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer more\\nbrandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that peculiar\\nfashion.\\n\\nAt that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\\nroom. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the\\nbed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled\\nvoice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\\n\\n\"Alfred--Alfred----\" Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\\n\\nWith a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked\\nthem energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration.\\nHe issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave of\\nhis hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated, though I\\nthink we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that nothing\\ncould be done now. I could see by the expression on his face that he\\nhimself had little hope.\\n\\nFinally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that moment,\\nwe heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s own\\ndoctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.\\n\\nIn a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\\npassing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the house\\nas fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins. With a\\nfaint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.\\n\\n\"Ve--ry sad. Ve--ry sad,\" murmured Dr. Wilkins. \"Poor dear lady. Always\\ndid far too much--far too much--against my advice. I warned her.\\nHer heart was far from strong. \\'Take it easy,\\' I said to her,\\n\\'Take--it--easy\\'. But no--her zeal for good works was too great. Nature\\nrebelled. Na--ture--re--belled.\"\\n\\nDr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. He\\nstill kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.\\n\\n\"The convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry\\nyou were not here in time to witness them. They were quite--tetanic in\\ncharacter.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Dr. Wilkins wisely.\\n\\n\"I should like to speak to you in private,\" said Dr. Bauerstein. He\\nturned to John. \"You do not object?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\\nWe all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone, and\\nI heard the key turned in the lock behind us.\\n\\nWe went slowly down the stairs. I was violently excited. I have a\\ncertain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauerstein\\'s manner had started a\\nflock of wild surmises in my mind. Mary Cavendish laid her hand upon my\\narm.\\n\\n\"What is it? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so--peculiar?\"\\n\\nI looked at her.\\n\\n\"Do you know what I think?\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"Listen!\" I looked round, the others were out of earshot. I lowered my\\nvoice to a whisper. \"I believe she has been poisoned! I\\'m certain Dr.\\nBauerstein suspects it.\"\\n\\n\"_What_?\" She shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating\\nwildly. Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: \"No,\\nno--not that--not that!\" And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. I\\nfollowed her, afraid that she was going to faint. I found her leaning\\nagainst the bannisters, deadly pale. She waved me away impatiently.\\n\\n\"No, no--leave me. I\\'d rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a\\nminute or two. Go down to the others.\"\\n\\nI obeyed her reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I\\njoined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of\\nus all when I at last broke it by saying:\\n\\n\"Where is Mr. Inglethorp?\"\\n\\nJohn shook his head.\\n\\n\"He\\'s not in the house.\"\\n\\nOur eyes met. Where _was_ Alfred Inglethorp? His absence was strange\\nand inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s dying words. What lay\\nbeneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time?\\n\\nAt last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins\\nwas looking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\\nexultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in\\nthe background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the\\nspokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John:\\n\\n\"Mr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a postmortem.\"\\n\\n\"Is that necessary?\" asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his\\nface.\\n\\n\"Absolutely,\" said Dr. Bauerstein.\\n\\n\"You mean by that----?\"\\n\\n\"That neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\\nunder the circumstances.\"\\n\\nJohn bent his head.\\n\\n\"In that case, I have no alternative but to agree.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Dr. Wilkins briskly. \"We propose that it should\\ntake place to-morrow night--or rather to-night.\" And he glanced at the\\ndaylight. \"Under the circumstances, I am afraid an inquest can hardly\\nbe avoided--these formalities are necessary, but I beg that you won\\'t\\ndistress yourselves.\"\\n\\nThere was a pause, and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his\\npocket, and handed them to John.\\n\\n\"These are the keys of the two rooms. I have locked them and, in my\\nopinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.\"\\n\\nThe doctors then departed.\\n\\nI had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment\\nhad now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John,\\nI knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\\noptimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be\\ndifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the\\nother hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I felt\\nI might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment had\\ncome for me to take the lead.\\n\\n\"John,\" I said, \"I am going to ask you something.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here?\\nHe has been a most famous detective.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I want you to let me call him in--to investigate this matter.\"\\n\\n\"What--now? Before the post-mortem?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, time is an advantage if--if--there has been foul play.\"\\n\\n\"Rubbish!\" cried Lawrence angrily. \"In my opinion the whole thing is\\na mare\\'s nest of Bauerstein\\'s! Wilkins hadn\\'t an idea of such a thing,\\nuntil Bauerstein put it into his head. But, like all specialists,\\nBauerstein\\'s got a bee in his bonnet. Poisons are his hobby, so of\\ncourse he sees them everywhere.\"\\n\\nI confess that I was surprised by Lawrence\\'s attitude. He was so seldom\\nvehement about anything.\\n\\nJohn hesitated.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t feel as you do, Lawrence,\" he said at last. \"I\\'m inclined to\\ngive Hastings a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We\\ndon\\'t want any unnecessary scandal.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" I cried eagerly, \"you need have no fear of that. Poirot is\\ndiscretion itself.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands.\\nThough, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. God\\nforgive me if I am wronging him!\"\\n\\nI looked at my watch. It was six o\\'clock. I determined to lose no time.\\n\\nFive minutes\\' delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in ransacking\\nthe library until I discovered a medical book which gave a description\\nof strychnine poisoning.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. POIROT INVESTIGATES\\n\\nThe house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\\nthe park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through\\nthe long grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I,\\naccordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my\\nattention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me. It\\nwas Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain his\\nabsence?\\n\\nHe accosted me eagerly.\\n\\n\"My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.\"\\n\\n\"Where have you been?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Denby kept me late last night. It was one o\\'clock before we\\'d finished.\\nThen I found that I\\'d forgotten the latch-key after all. I didn\\'t want\\nto arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.\"\\n\\n\"How did you hear the news?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so\\nself-sacrificing--such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.\"\\n\\nA wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man\\nwas!\\n\\n\"I must hurry on,\" I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I was\\nbound.\\n\\nIn a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.\\n\\nGetting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me\\nwas cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.\\n\\nHe gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words, I\\nexplained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help.\\n\\n\"Wait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the\\naffair whilst I dress.\"\\n\\nIn a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his\\nroom. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole\\nstory, keeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however\\ninsignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.\\n\\nI told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s dying words, of her\\nhusband\\'s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of\\nconversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard, of\\nthe former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of the\\nlatter\\'s innuendoes.\\n\\nI was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times,\\nand occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.\\nPoirot smiled kindly on me.\\n\\n\"The mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, _mon ami_. You are\\nagitated; you are excited--it is but natural. Presently, when we are\\ncalmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We\\nwill examine--and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side;\\nthose of no importance, pouf!\"--he screwed up his cherub-like face, and\\npuffed comically enough--\"blow them away!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all very well,\" I objected, \"but how are you going to decide\\nwhat is important, and what isn\\'t? That always seems the difficulty to\\nme.\"\\n\\nPoirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache\\nwith exquisite care.\\n\\n\"Not so. _Voyons_! One fact leads to another--so we continue. Does the\\nnext fit in with that? _A merveille_! Good! We can proceed. This next\\nlittle fact--no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing--a link\\nin the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little\\ncurious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,\\nwe put it here!\" He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. \"It is\\nsignificant! It is tremendous!\"\\n\\n\"Y--es--\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed\\nbefore it. \"Beware! Peril to the detective who says: \\'It is so small--it\\ndoes not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.\\' That way lies\\nconfusion! Everything matters.\"\\n\\n\"I know. You always told me that. That\\'s why I have gone into all the\\ndetails of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.\"\\n\\n\"And I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given\\nme the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say\\nnothing--truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowances--you are upset.\\nTo that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\\nparamount importance.\"\\n\\n\"What is that?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"You have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.\"\\n\\nI stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little man\\'s brain.\\nHe was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and\\nseemed wholly engrossed in the task.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t remember,\" I said. \"And, anyway, I don\\'t see----\"\\n\\n\"You do not see? But it is of the first importance.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see why,\" I said, rather nettled. \"As far as I can remember,\\nshe didn\\'t eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had taken her\\nappetite away. That was only natural.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Poirot thoughtfully, \"it was only natural.\"\\n\\nHe opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to\\nme.\\n\\n\"Now I am ready. We will proceed to the chateau, and study matters on\\nthe spot. Excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is on\\none side. Permit me.\" With a deft gesture, he rearranged it.\\n\\n\"_Ça y est!_ Now, shall we start?\"\\n\\nWe hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. Poirot\\nstopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\\nof park, still glittering with morning dew.\\n\\n\"So beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in\\nsorrow, prostrated with grief.\"\\n\\nHe looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened\\nunder his prolonged gaze.\\n\\nWas the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s\\ndeath so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the\\natmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her\\ndeath was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately\\nregretted.\\n\\nPoirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.\\n\\n\"No, you are right,\" he said, \"it is not as though there was a blood\\ntie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was\\nnot their own mother. Blood tells--always remember that--blood tells.\"\\n\\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\\nMrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my\\nmind, but I can\\'t see how it has anything to do with the matter?\"\\n\\nHe was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"I do not mind telling you--though, as you know, it is not my habit to\\nexplain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs.\\nInglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her\\ncoffee.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\n\"Well, what time was the coffee served?\"\\n\\n\"About eight o\\'clock.\"\\n\\n\"Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight--certainly not\\nmuch later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects would\\nbe felt very soon, probably in about an hour. Yet, in Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s\\ncase, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five o\\'clock the\\nnext morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about the same time\\nas the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to that extent.\\nStill, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But, according to\\nyou, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms do not develop\\nuntil early the next morning! Now that is a curious circumstance,\\nmy friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain it. In the\\nmeantime, remember it.\"\\n\\nAs we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face looked weary\\nand haggard.\\n\\n\"This is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,\" he said. \"Hastings\\nhas explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?\"\\n\\n\"I comprehend perfectly.\"\\n\\n\"You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.\"\\n\\n\"Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only.\"\\n\\nJohn turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a\\ncigarette as he did so.\\n\\n\"You know that fellow Inglethorp is back?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I met him.\"\\n\\nJohn flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which was\\ntoo much for Poirot\\'s feelings. He retrieved it, and buried it neatly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.\"\\n\\n\"That difficulty will not exist long,\" pronounced Poirot quietly.\\n\\nJohn looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this cryptic\\nsaying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given him to me.\\n\\n\"Show Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.\"\\n\\n\"The rooms are locked?\" asked Poirot.\\n\\n\"Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.\"\\n\\nWe went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I append\\na plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in it.\\n\\nPoirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute\\ninspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the\\nagility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate\\nany clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my\\nforbearance.\\n\\n\"What have you, my friend,\" he cried, \"that you remain there like--how\\ndo you say it?--ah, yes, the stuck pig?\"\\n\\n\\nI explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.\\n\\n\"Foot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an\\narmy in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here\\nand aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need\\nit.\"\\n\\nHe did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\\nproceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\\nprecipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\\n\\n\"_Eh voilà une table!_\" cried Poirot. \"Ah, my friend, one may live in a\\nbig house and yet have no comfort.\"\\n\\nAfter which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.\\n\\nA small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\\nwriting-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key\\nfrom the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar,\\nhowever. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted\\nwire through the handle.\\n\\nNext, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\\nhimself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door\\nopposite leading into Cynthia\\'s room. That door was also bolted, as I\\nhad stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\\nand shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\\nagainst making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\\nto rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\\nwhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\\nminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\\n\\nOn the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a\\nsmall saucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\\nsaucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\\nnear it.\\n\\nI wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\\nHere was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into\\nliquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.\\n\\n\"Cocoa--with--I think--rum in it.\"\\n\\nHe passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\\nbeen overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\\nand the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\\n\\n\"Ah, this is curious,\" said Poirot.\\n\\n\"I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.\"\\n\\n\"You do not? Observe the lamp--the chimney is broken in two places; they\\nlie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed to\\npowder.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" I said wearily, \"I suppose someone must have stepped on it.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly,\" said Poirot, in an odd voice. \"Someone stepped on it.\"\\n\\nHe rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\\nwhere he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\\nthem--a trick of his when he was agitated.\\n\\n\"_Mon ami_,\" he said, turning to me, \"somebody stepped on that cup,\\ngrinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\\ncontained strychnine or--which is far more serious--because it did not\\ncontain strychnine!\"\\n\\nI made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good asking\\nhim to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went on with\\nhis investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the floor, and\\ntwirling them round in his fingers finally selected one, very bright\\nand shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple despatch-case. It\\nfitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment\\'s hesitation, closed\\nand relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as well as the key that\\nhad originally stood in the lock, into his own pocket.\\n\\n\"I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be\\ndone--at once!\"\\n\\nHe then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\\nwash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\\nhardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\\nparticularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutely--even\\ngoing so far as to smell it.\\n\\nFinally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing it\\nup carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\\n\\n\"We have found in this room,\" he said, writing busily, \"six points of\\ninterest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you,\" I replied hastily.\\n\\n\"Very well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\\ntwo, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\\nfloor.\"\\n\\n\"That may have been done some time ago,\" I interrupted.\\n\\n\"No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four,\\na fragment of some dark green fabric--only a thread or two, but\\nrecognizable.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" I cried. \"That was what you sealed up in the envelope.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s own\\ndresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!\" With a\\ndramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\\nfloor by the writing-table. \"It must have been done since yesterday,\\notherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\\nblotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once--but that is not\\nto the point.\"\\n\\n\"It was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps\\nMrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.\"\\n\\n\"You brought only one candle into the room?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He\\nseemed to see something over here\"--I indicated the mantelpiece--\"that\\nabsolutely paralysed him.\"\\n\\n\"That is interesting,\" said Poirot quickly. \"Yes, it is suggestive\"--his\\neye sweeping the whole length of the wall--\"but it was not his candle\\nthat made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white\\ngrease; whereas Monsieur Lawrence\\'s candle, which is still on the\\ndressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no\\ncandlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" I said, \"what do you deduce?\"\\n\\nTo which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to use\\nmy own natural faculties.\\n\\n\"And the sixth point?\" I asked. \"I suppose it is the sample of cocoa.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Poirot thoughtfully. \"I might have included that in the\\nsix, but I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the\\npresent.\"\\n\\nHe looked quickly round the room. \"There is nothing more to be done\\nhere, I think, unless\"--he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\\nin the grate. \"The fire burns--and it destroys. But by chance--there\\nmight be--let us see!\"\\n\\nDeftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\\ninto the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he\\ngave a faint exclamation.\\n\\n\"The forceps, Hastings!\"\\n\\nI quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\\nof half charred paper.\\n\\n\"There, _mon ami!_\" he cried. \"What do you think of that?\"\\n\\nI scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:--\\n\\n\\nI was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\\nSuddenly an idea struck me.\\n\\n\"Poirot!\" I cried. \"This is a fragment of a will!\"\\n\\n\"Exactly.\"\\n\\nI looked up at him sharply.\\n\\n\"You are not surprised?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" he said gravely, \"I expected it.\"\\n\\nI relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\\ncase, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything.\\nMy brain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had\\ndestroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\\nObviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been\\nbolted on the inside.\\n\\n\"Now, my friend,\" said Poirot briskly, \"we will go. I should like to ask\\na few questions of the parlourmaid--Dorcas, her name is, is it not?\"\\n\\nWe passed through Alfred Inglethorp\\'s room, and Poirot delayed long\\nenough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it.\\nWe went out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.\\nInglethorp\\'s room as before.\\n\\nI took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see, and\\nwent myself in search of Dorcas.\\n\\nWhen I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\\n\\n\"Poirot,\" I cried, \"where are you?\"\\n\\n\"I am here, my friend.\"\\n\\nHe had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently\\nlost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\\n\\n\"Admirable!\" he murmured. \"Admirable! What symmetry! Observe that\\ncrescent; and those diamonds--their neatness rejoices the eye. The\\nspacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is\\nit not so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in--Dorcas\\nis here.\"\\n\\n\"_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a moment\\'s satisfaction of the\\neye.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but this affair is more important.\"\\n\\n\"And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\\nimportance?\"\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he\\nchose to take that line.\\n\\n\"You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and\\ninterview the brave Dorcas.\"\\n\\nDorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\\nand her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the\\nvery model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\\n\\nIn her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\\nhe soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.\\n\\n\"Pray be seated, mademoiselle.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?\"\\n\\n\"Ten years, sir.\"\\n\\n\"That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached\\nto her, were you not?\"\\n\\n\"She was a very good mistress to me, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to\\nyou with Mr. Cavendish\\'s full approval.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\\nafternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. But I don\\'t know that I ought----\" Dorcas hesitated. Poirot\\nlooked at her keenly.\\n\\n\"My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of that\\nquarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying your\\nmistress\\'s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary that we\\nshould know all--if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her back to\\nlife, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the murderer\\nto justice.\"\\n\\n\"Amen to that,\" said Dorcas fiercely. \"And, naming no names, there\\'s\\n_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it\\nwas when first _he_ darkened the threshold.\"\\n\\nPoirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\\nbusiness-like tone, he asked:\\n\\n\"Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday----\"\\n\\n\"What time was that?\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t say exactly, sir, but it wasn\\'t tea-time by a long way.\\nPerhaps four o\\'clock--or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I\\nsaid, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and\\nangry in here. I didn\\'t exactly mean to listen, but--well, there it is.\\nI stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\\nand clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. \\'You have lied\\nto me, and deceived me,\\' she said. I didn\\'t hear what Mr. Inglethorp\\nreplied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did--but she answered:\\n\\'How dare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe\\neverything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace\\nupon our name!\\' Again I didn\\'t hear what he said, but she went on:\\n\\'Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty\\nclearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of\\npublicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\\' Then I\\nthought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.\"\\n\\n\"You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp\\'s voice you heard?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, sir, whose else\\'s could it be?\"\\n\\n\"Well, what happened next?\"\\n\\n\"Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o\\'clock,\\nMrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\\ntea--nothing to eat--to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful--so white\\nand upset. \\'Dorcas,\\' she says, \\'I\\'ve had a great shock.\\' \\'I\\'m sorry for\\nthat, m\\'m,\\' I says. \\'You\\'ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\\nm\\'m.\\' She had something in her hand. I don\\'t know if it was a letter, or\\njust a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept staring\\nat it, almost as if she couldn\\'t believe what was written there. She\\nwhispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was there: \\'These\\nfew words--and everything\\'s changed.\\' And then she says to me: \\'Never\\ntrust a man, Dorcas, they\\'re not worth it!\\' I hurried off, and got her\\na good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said she\\'d feel better\\nwhen she\\'d drunk it. \\'I don\\'t know what to do,\\' she says. \\'Scandal\\nbetween husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas. I\\'d rather hush it\\nup if I could.\\' Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so she didn\\'t say any\\nmore.\"\\n\\n\"She still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"What would she be likely to do with it afterwards?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple\\ncase of hers.\"\\n\\n\"Is that where she usually kept important papers?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\\nevery night.\"\\n\\n\"When did she lose the key of it?\"\\n\\n\"She missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\\ncarefully for it. She was very much put out about it.\"\\n\\n\"But she had a duplicate key?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, sir.\"\\n\\nDorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\\nI. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.\\n\\n\"Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key\\nthat was lost?\" He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in the\\nlock of the despatch-case upstairs.\\n\\nDorcas\\'s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\\n\\n\"That\\'s it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked\\neverywhere for it.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\\nto-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\\ndress in her wardrobe?\"\\n\\nDorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Are you quite sure?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?\"\\n\\nDorcas reflected.\\n\\n\"Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress.\"\\n\\n\"Light or dark green?\"\\n\\n\"A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir--not that I know of.\"\\n\\nPoirot\\'s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\\notherwise. He merely remarked:\\n\\n\"Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe\\nthat your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?\"\\n\\n\"Not _last_ night, sir, I know she didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Why do you know so positively?\"\\n\\n\"Because the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she\\ndidn\\'t have any more made up.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite sure of that?\"\\n\\n\"Positive, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn\\'t ask you to\\nsign any paper yesterday?\"\\n\\n\"To sign a paper? No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\\nfound your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no\\nidea to whom these letters were addressed?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid I couldn\\'t, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie\\ncould tell you, though she\\'s a careless girl. Never cleared the\\ncoffee-cups away last night. That\\'s what happens when I\\'m not here to\\nlook after things.\"\\n\\nPoirot lifted his hand.\\n\\n\"Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray\\nyou. I should like to examine them.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, sir.\"\\n\\n\"What time did you go out last evening?\"\\n\\n\"About six o\\'clock, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.\" He rose and strolled\\nto the window. \"I have been admiring these flower beds. How many\\ngardeners are employed here, by the way?\"\\n\\n\"Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\\na gentleman\\'s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then,\\nsir. A fair sight it was. But now there\\'s only old Manning, and young\\nWilliam, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\\nAh, these are dreadful times!\"\\n\\n\"The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now, will\\nyou send Annie to me here?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.\"\\n\\n\"How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?\" I asked,\\nin lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. \"And about the lost key\\nand the duplicate?\"\\n\\n\"One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.\"\\nHe suddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\\npowders.\\n\\n\"Where did you find it?\"\\n\\n\"In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s bedroom. It was Number\\nSix of my catalogue.\"\\n\\n\"But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\\nmuch importance?\"\\n\\n\"Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\\nabout this box?\"\\n\\nI examined it closely.\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t say that I do.\"\\n\\n\"Look at the label.\"\\n\\nI read the label carefully: \"\\'One powder to be taken at bedtime, if\\nrequired. Mrs. Inglethorp.\\' No, I see nothing unusual.\"\\n\\n\"Not the fact that there is no chemist\\'s name?\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" I exclaimed. \"To be sure, that is odd!\"\\n\\n\"Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\\nprinted name?\"\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t say that I have.\"\\n\\nI was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\\n\\n\"Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my\\nfriend.\"\\n\\nAn audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time\\nto reply.\\n\\nAnnie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\\nintense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\\ntragedy.\\n\\nPoirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\\n\\n\"I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me\\nsomething about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many\\nwere there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?\"\\n\\nAnnie considered.\\n\\n\"There were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was\\nto Mr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don\\'t think I remember,\\nsir--oh, yes, one was to Ross\\'s, the caterers in Tadminster. The other\\none, I don\\'t remember.\"\\n\\n\"Think,\" urged Poirot.\\n\\nAnnie racked her brains in vain.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry, sir, but it\\'s clean gone. I don\\'t think I can have noticed\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"It does not matter,\" said Poirot, not betraying any sign of\\ndisappointment. \"Now I want to ask you about something else. There is a\\nsaucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s room with some cocoa in it. Did she have\\nthat every night?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up in\\nthe night--whenever she fancied it.\"\\n\\n\"What was it? Plain cocoa?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\\nteaspoonfuls of rum in it.\"\\n\\n\"Who took it to her room?\"\\n\\n\"I did, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Always?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"At what time?\"\\n\\n\"When I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, you see there\\'s not much room on the gas stove, so Cook used\\nto make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I\\nused to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and take\\nit into her room later.\"\\n\\n\"The swing door is in the left wing, is it not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"And the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the\\nfarther--servants\\' side?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s this side, sir.\"\\n\\n\"What time did you bring it up last night?\"\\n\\n\"About quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.\"\\n\\n\"And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s room?\"\\n\\n\"When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o\\'clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came\\nup to bed before I\\'d finished.\"\\n\\n\"Then, between 7.15 and 8 o\\'clock, the cocoa was standing on the table\\nin the left wing?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\" Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\\nnow she blurted out unexpectedly:\\n\\n\"And if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn\\'t me. I never took the salt\\nnear it.\"\\n\\n\"What makes you think there was salt in it?\" asked Poirot.\\n\\n\"Seeing it on the tray, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You saw some salt on the tray?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took the\\ntray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress\\'s room I saw it at\\nonce, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and asked Cook\\nto make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was out, and I\\nthought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt had only gone\\non the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took it in.\"\\n\\nI had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to\\nherself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How\\nshe would have gaped if she had realized that her \"coarse kitchen salt\"\\nwas strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I\\nmarvelled at Poirot\\'s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited\\nhis next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\\n\\n\"When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s room, was the door leading into\\nMiss Cynthia\\'s room bolted?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.\"\\n\\n\"And the door into Mr. Inglethorp\\'s room? Did you notice if that was\\nbolted too?\"\\n\\nAnnie hesitated.\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn\\'t say whether it\\nwas bolted or not.\"\\n\\n\"When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door after\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it\\nat night. The door into the passage, that is.\"\\n\\n\"Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\\nyesterday?\"\\n\\n\"Candle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn\\'t have a candle, only\\na reading-lamp.\"\\n\\n\"Then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\\nyou think you would have been sure to have seen it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\\nand a hot iron.\"\\n\\nThen Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:\\n\\n\"Did your mistress ever have a green dress?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a--how do you call it?--a sports coat?\"\\n\\n\"Not green, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Nor anyone else in the house?\"\\n\\nAnnie reflected.\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You are sure of that?\"\\n\\n\"Quite sure.\"\\n\\n\"_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.\"\\n\\nWith a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room. My\\npent-up excitement burst forth.\\n\\n\"Poirot,\" I cried, \"I congratulate you! This is a great discovery.\"\\n\\n\"What is a great discovery?\"\\n\\n\"Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That\\nexplains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early\\nmorning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.\"\\n\\n\"So you think that the cocoa--mark well what I say, Hastings, the\\n_cocoa_--contained strychnine?\"\\n\\n\"Of course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?\"\\n\\n\"It might have been salt,\" replied Poirot placidly.\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way,\\nit was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the\\nfirst time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought it\\nlucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive type\\nof mind.\\n\\nPoirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\\n\\n\"You are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_\"\\n\\n\"My dear Poirot,\" I said coldly, \"it is not for me to dictate to you.\\nYou have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.\"\\n\\n\"A most admirable sentiment,\" remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his\\nfeet. \"Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the\\nsmaller desk in the corner?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Inglethorp\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" He tried the roll top tentatively. \"Locked. But perhaps one of\\nMrs. Inglethorp\\'s keys would open it.\" He tried several, twisting and\\nturning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\\nof satisfaction. \"_Voilà!_ It is not the key, but it will open it at a\\npinch.\" He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\\nfiled papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\\napprovingly as he relocked the desk: \"Decidedly, he is a man of method,\\nthis Mr. Inglethorp!\"\\n\\nA \"man of method\" was, in Poirot\\'s estimation, the highest praise that\\ncould be bestowed on any individual.\\n\\nI felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\\ndisconnectedly:\\n\\n\"There were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh,\\n_mon ami?_ There might have been? Yes\"--his eyes wandered round the\\nroom--\"this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much.\\nOnly this.\"\\n\\nHe pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over\\nto me. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old\\nenvelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. The\\nfollowing is a facsimile of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. \"IT ISN\\'T STRYCHNINE, IS IT?\"\\n\\n\"Where did you find this?\" I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity.\\n\\n\"In the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s. But what does it mean?\"\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\"I cannot say--but it is suggestive.\"\\n\\nA wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s\\nmind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal possession?\\nAnd, if that were so, was it not also possible that she might have taken\\nher own life?\\n\\nI was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words\\ndistracted me.\\n\\n\"Come,\" he said, \"now to examine the coffee-cups!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know\\nabout the cocoa?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _là là!_ That miserable cocoa!\" cried Poirot flippantly.\\n\\nHe laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\\ndespair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.\\n\\n\"And, anyway,\" I said, with increasing coldness, \"as Mrs. Inglethorp\\ntook her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to\\nfind, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\\nstrychnine on the coffee tray!\"\\n\\nPoirot was sobered at once.\\n\\n\"Come, come, my friend,\" he said, slipping his arms through mine. \"_Ne\\nvous fâchez pas!_ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I\\nwill respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?\"\\n\\nHe was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went\\ntogether to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\\nundisturbed as we had left them.\\n\\nPoirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\\nvery carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\\n\\n\"So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray--and poured out. Yes. Then she came\\nacross to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here\\nare the three cups. And the cup on the mantel-piece, half drunk, that\\nwould be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\\'s. And the one on the tray?\"\\n\\n\"John Cavendish\\'s. I saw him put it down there.\"\\n\\n\"Good. One, two, three, four, five--but where, then, is the cup of Mr.\\nInglethorp?\"\\n\\n\"He does not take coffee.\"\\n\\n\"Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.\"\\n\\nWith infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,\\nsealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did\\nso. His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered\\nthere that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.\\n\\n\"_Bien!_\" he said at last. \"It is evident! I had an idea--but clearly I\\nwas mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no\\nmatter!\"\\n\\nAnd, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was\\nworrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning\\nthat this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\\nalley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot\\nhad been a great man in his day.\\n\\n\"Breakfast is ready,\" said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall. \"You\\nwill breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?\"\\n\\nPoirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to\\nhis normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset him\\ntemporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal. He was\\na man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his brother,\\nwho had, perhaps, too much.\\n\\nEver since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work,\\nsending telegrams--one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard--writing\\nnotices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the\\nmelancholy duties that a death entails.\\n\\n\"May I ask how things are proceeding?\" he said. \"Do your investigations\\npoint to my mother having died a natural death--or--or must we prepare\\nourselves for the worst?\"\\n\\n\"I think, Mr. Cavendish,\" said Poirot gravely, \"that you would do well\\nnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views\\nof the other members of the family?\"\\n\\n\"My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\\nnothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of\\nheart failure.\"\\n\\n\"He does, does he? That is very interesting--very interesting,\" murmured\\nPoirot softly. \"And Mrs. Cavendish?\"\\n\\nA faint cloud passed over John\\'s face.\\n\\n\"I have not the least idea what my wife\\'s views on the subject are.\"\\n\\nThe answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the\\nrather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:\\n\\n\"I told you, didn\\'t I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?\"\\n\\nPoirot bent his head.\\n\\n\"It\\'s an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him\\nas usual--but, hang it all, one\\'s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\\nwith a possible murderer!\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n\"I quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr.\\nCavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp\\'s reason\\nfor not returning last night was, I believe, that he had forgotten the\\nlatch-key. Is not that so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten--that\\nhe did not take it after all?\"\\n\\n\"I have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the\\nhall drawer. I\\'ll go and see if it\\'s there now.\"\\n\\nPoirot held up his hand with a faint smile.\\n\\n\"No, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would\\nfind it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to replace\\nit by now.\"\\n\\n\"But do you think----\"\\n\\n\"I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\\nreturn, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his\\nfavour. That is all.\"\\n\\nJohn looked perplexed.\\n\\n\"Do not worry,\" said Poirot smoothly. \"I assure you that you need not\\nlet it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some\\nbreakfast.\"\\n\\nEvery one was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances,\\nwe were naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is\\nalways trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and\\ngood breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\\nusual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really a\\nmatter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of secretly\\nindulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that Dorcas was\\nthe person most affected by the personal side of the tragedy.\\n\\nI pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a\\nmanner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that\\nwe suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the\\nfact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear,\\nor was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the\\nsuspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\\nman.\\n\\nBut did every one suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her\\nas she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In\\nher soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\\nslender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her\\nface could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent,\\nhardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the great\\nstrength of her personality was dominating us all.\\n\\nAnd little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I\\nthought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I\\nasked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ve got the most beastly headache.\"\\n\\n\"Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?\" said Poirot solicitously.\\n\"It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the _mal de tête_.\" He\\njumped up and took her cup.\\n\\n\"No sugar,\" said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the sugar-tongs.\\n\\n\"No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?\"\\n\\n\"No, I never take it in coffee.\"\\n\\n\"_Sacré!_\" murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the\\nreplenished cup.\\n\\nOnly I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw that\\nhis face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were as\\ngreen as a cat\\'s. He had heard or seen something that had affected him\\nstrongly--but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense, but\\nI must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_\\nattention.\\n\\nIn another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared.\\n\\n\"Mr. Wells to see you, sir,\" she said to John.\\n\\nI remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs.\\nInglethorp had written the night before.\\n\\nJohn rose immediately.\\n\\n\"Show him into my study.\" Then he turned to us. \"My mother\\'s lawyer,\"\\nhe explained. And in a lower voice: \"He is also Coroner--you understand.\\nPerhaps you would like to come with me?\"\\n\\nWe acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead and\\nI took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot:\\n\\n\"There will be an inquest then?\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that\\nmy curiosity was aroused.\\n\\n\"What is it? You are not attending to what I say.\"\\n\\n\"It is true, my friend. I am much worried.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.\"\\n\\n\"What? You cannot be serious?\"\\n\\n\"But I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not\\nunderstand. My instinct was right.\"\\n\\n\"What instinct?\"\\n\\n\"The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.\\n_Chut_! no more now!\"\\n\\nWe followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us.\\n\\nMr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the\\ntypical lawyer\\'s mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the\\nreason of our presence.\\n\\n\"You will understand, Wells,\" he added, \"that this is all strictly\\nprivate. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\\ninvestigation of any kind.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" said Mr. Wells soothingly. \"I wish we could have\\nspared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it\\'s\\nquite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor\\'s certificate.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I suppose so.\"\\n\\n\"Clever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he\\nadded rather hesitatingly: \"Shall we have to appear as witnesses--all of\\nus, I mean?\"\\n\\n\"You, of course--and ah--er--Mr.--er--Inglethorp.\"\\n\\nA slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:\\n\\n\"Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of form.\"\\n\\n\"I see.\"\\n\\nA faint expression of relief swept over John\\'s face. It puzzled me, for\\nI saw no occasion for it.\\n\\n\"If you know of nothing to the contrary,\" pursued Mr. Wells, \"I had\\nthought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor\\'s\\nreport. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Then that arrangement will suit you?\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly.\"\\n\\n\"I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this\\nmost tragic affair.\"\\n\\n\"Can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?\" interposed Poirot,\\nspeaking for the first time since we had entered the room.\\n\\n\"I?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should\\nhave received the letter this morning.\"\\n\\n\"I did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me to\\ncall upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of great\\nimportance.\"\\n\\n\"She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?\"\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, no.\"\\n\\n\"That is a pity,\" said John.\\n\\n\"A great pity,\" agreed Poirot gravely.\\n\\nThere was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.\\nFinally he turned to the lawyer again.\\n\\n\"Mr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you--that is, if it\\nis not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s\\ndeath, who would inherit her money?\"\\n\\nThe lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:\\n\\n\"The knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish\\ndoes not object----\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" interpolated John.\\n\\n\"I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her\\nlast will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant legacies\\nto servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson, Mr. John\\nCavendish.\"\\n\\n\"Was not that--pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish--rather unfair to her\\nother stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father\\'s will,\\nwhile John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother\\'s death,\\nwould come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp left\\nher money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep up\\nStyles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"I see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law\\nthat will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?\"\\n\\nMr. Wells bowed his head.\\n\\n\"As I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null\\nand void.\"\\n\\n\"_Hein!_\" said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: \"Was\\nMrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. She may have been.\"\\n\\n\"She was,\" said John unexpectedly. \"We were discussing the matter of\\nwills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say \\'her last will.\\' Had Mrs.\\nInglethorp, then, made several former wills?\"\\n\\n\"On an average, she made a new will at least once a year,\" said Mr.\\nWells imperturbably. \"She was given to changing her mind as to her\\ntestamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of her\\nfamily.\"\\n\\n\"Suppose,\" suggested Poirot, \"that, unknown to you, she had made a\\nnew will in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a\\nmember of the family--we will say Miss Howard, for instance--would you\\nbe surprised?\"\\n\\n\"Not in the least.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" Poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.\\n\\nI drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the\\nquestion of going through Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s papers.\\n\\n\"Do you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss\\nHoward?\" I asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Then why did you ask?\"\\n\\n\"Hush!\"\\n\\nJohn Cavendish had turned to Poirot.\\n\\n\"Will you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my\\nmother\\'s papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely to\\nMr. Wells and myself.\"\\n\\n\"Which simplifies matters very much,\" murmured the lawyer. \"As\\ntechnically, of course, he was entitled----\" He did not finish the\\nsentence.\\n\\n\"We will look through the desk in the boudoir first,\" explained John,\\n\"and go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important papers\\nin a purple despatch-case, which we must look through carefully.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the lawyer, \"it is quite possible that there may be a later\\nwill than the one in my possession.\"\\n\\n\"There _is_ a later will.\" It was Poirot who spoke.\\n\\n\"What?\" John and the lawyer looked at him startled.\\n\\n\"Or, rather,\" pursued my friend imperturbably, \"there _was_ one.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean--there was one? Where is it now?\"\\n\\n\"Burnt!\"\\n\\n\"Burnt?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. See here.\" He took out the charred fragment we had found in the\\ngrate in Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a\\nbrief explanation of when and where he had found it.\\n\\n\"But possibly this is an old will?\"\\n\\n\"I do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no\\nearlier than yesterday afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" \"Impossible!\" broke simultaneously from both men.\\n\\nPoirot turned to John.\\n\\n\"If you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, of course--but I don\\'t see----\"\\n\\nPoirot raised his hand.\\n\\n\"Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.\"\\n\\n\"Very well.\" He rang the bell.\\n\\nDorcas answered it in due course.\\n\\n\"Dorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\nDorcas withdrew.\\n\\nWe waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his ease,\\nand dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.\\n\\nThe clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the\\napproach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter\\nnodded.\\n\\n\"Come inside, Manning,\" said John, \"I want to speak to you.\"\\n\\nManning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and\\nstood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it\\nvery carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he\\nwas probably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\\nintelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.\\n\\n\"Manning,\" said John, \"this gentleman will put some questions to you\\nwhich I want you to answer.\"\\n\\n\"Yes sir,\" mumbled Manning.\\n\\nPoirot stepped forward briskly. Manning\\'s eye swept over him with a\\nfaint contempt.\\n\\n\"You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the\\nhouse yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, me and Willum.\"\\n\\n\"And Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, she did.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle down\\nto the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like--I don\\'t\\nknow what exactly--she wrote it down for him.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"Well, he did, sir.\"\\n\\n\"And what happened next?\"\\n\\n\"We went on with the begonias, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Did not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.\"\\n\\n\"And then?\"\\n\\n\"She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long\\npaper--under where she\\'d signed.\"\\n\\n\"Did you see anything of what was written above her signature?\" asked\\nPoirot sharply.\\n\\n\"No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.\"\\n\\n\"And you signed where she told you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, first me and then Willum.\"\\n\\n\"What did she do with it afterwards?\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\\nsort of purple box that was standing on the desk.\"\\n\\n\"What time was it when she first called you?\"\\n\\n\"About four, I should say, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Not earlier? Couldn\\'t it have been about half-past three?\"\\n\\n\"No, I shouldn\\'t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after\\nfour--not before it.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Manning, that will do,\" said Poirot pleasantly.\\n\\nThe gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning lifted\\na finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed cautiously out of\\nthe window.\\n\\nWe all looked at each other.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" murmured John. \"What an extraordinary coincidence.\"\\n\\n\"How--a coincidence?\"\\n\\n\"That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!\"\\n\\nMr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:\\n\\n\"Are you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with--someone yesterday\\nafternoon----\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice,\\nand he had gone very pale.\\n\\n\"In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and hurriedly\\nmakes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never know. She\\ntold no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she would have\\nconsulted me on the subject--but she had no chance. The will disappears,\\nand she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish, I much fear\\nthere is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure you agree with\\nme that the facts are very suggestive.\"\\n\\n\"Suggestive, or not,\" interrupted John, \"we are most grateful to\\nMonsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should never\\nhave known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur, what\\nfirst led you to suspect the fact?\"\\n\\nPoirot smiled and answered:\\n\\n\"A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.\"\\n\\nJohn, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\\nmoment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\\nwindow as it swept past.\\n\\n\"Evie!\" cried John. \"Excuse me, Wells.\" He went hurriedly out into the\\nhall.\\n\\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me.\\n\\n\"Miss Howard,\" I explained.\\n\\n\"Ah, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart\\ntoo, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!\"\\n\\nI followed John\\'s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss Howard\\nwas endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veils\\nthat enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang of guilt\\nshot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so earnestly,\\nand to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon, and how\\ncontemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she had been\\nproved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She had known\\nAlfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she had remained\\nat Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would the man have\\nfeared her watchful eyes?\\n\\nI was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\\npainful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\\nthat she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her\\neyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\\n\\n\"Started the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired car.\\nQuickest way to get here.\"\\n\\n\"Have you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?\" asked John.\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"I thought not. Come along, breakfast\\'s not cleared away yet, and\\nthey\\'ll make you some fresh tea.\" He turned to me. \"Look after her,\\nHastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, here\\'s Monsieur Poirot.\\nHe\\'s helping us, you know, Evie.\"\\n\\nMiss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her\\nshoulder at John.\\n\\n\"What do you mean--helping us?\"\\n\\n\"Helping us to investigate.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing to investigate. Have they taken him to prison yet?\"\\n\\n\"Taken who to prison?\"\\n\\n\"Who? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother\\ndied from heart seizure.\"\\n\\n\"More fool, Lawrence!\" retorted Miss Howard. \"Of course Alfred\\nInglethorp murdered poor Emily--as I always told you he would.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Evie, don\\'t shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is\\nbetter to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn\\'t\\nuntil Friday.\"\\n\\n\"Not until fiddlesticks!\" The snort Miss Howard gave was truly\\nmagnificent. \"You\\'re all off your heads. The man will be out of the\\ncountry by then. If he\\'s any sense, he won\\'t stay here tamely and wait\\nto be hanged.\"\\n\\nJohn Cavendish looked at her helplessly.\\n\\n\"I know what it is,\" she accused him, \"you\\'ve been listening to the\\ndoctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all--or just enough\\nto make them dangerous. I ought to know--my own father was a doctor.\\nThat little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever\\nseen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense\\ncould see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he\\'d\\nmurder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he\\'s done it. And all you can do\\nis to murmur silly things about \\'heart seizure\\' and \\'inquest on Friday.\\'\\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.\"\\n\\n\"What do you want me to do?\" asked John, unable to help a faint smile.\\n\"Dash it all, Evie, I can\\'t haul him down to the local police station by\\nthe scruff of his neck.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He\\'s a crafty\\nbeggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask Cook if she\\'s missed any.\"\\n\\nIt occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss\\nHoward and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\\nbetween them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not\\nenvy John. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully\\nappreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought\\nrefuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.\\n\\nDorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over from\\nthe window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss Howard.\\n\\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he said gravely, \"I want to ask you something.\"\\n\\n\"Ask away,\" said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.\\n\\n\"I want to be able to count upon your help.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,\" she replied gruffly.\\n\"Hanging\\'s too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in\\ngood old times.\"\\n\\n\"We are at one then,\" said Poirot, \"for I, too, want to hang the\\ncriminal.\"\\n\\n\"Alfred Inglethorp?\"\\n\\n\"Him, or another.\"\\n\\n\"No question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until _he_ came\\nalong. I don\\'t say she wasn\\'t surrounded by sharks--she was. But it\\nwas only her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along\\ncomes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp--and within two months--hey presto!\"\\n\\n\"Believe me, Miss Howard,\" said Poirot very earnestly, \"if Mr.\\nInglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will hang\\nhim as high as Haman!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s better,\" said Miss Howard more enthusiastically.\\n\\n\"But I must ask you to trust me. Now your help may be very valuable to\\nme. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours\\nare the only eyes that have wept.\"\\n\\nMiss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her\\nvoice.\\n\\n\"If you mean that I was fond of her--yes, I was. You know, Emily was\\na selfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always\\nwanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for\\nthem--and, that way she missed love. Don\\'t think she ever realized it,\\nthough, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different\\nfooting. I took my stand from the first. \\'So many pounds a year I\\'m\\nworth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides--not a\\npair of gloves, nor a theatre ticket.\\' She didn\\'t understand--was very\\noffended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn\\'t that--but I\\ncouldn\\'t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the\\nwhole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of\\nher. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a\\nglib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion\\ngo for nothing.\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\n\"I understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most\\nnatural. You think that we are lukewarm--that we lack fire and\\nenergy--but trust me, it is not so.\"\\n\\nJohn stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come\\nup to Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking\\nthrough the desk in the boudoir.\\n\\nAs we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and\\nlowered his voice confidentially:\\n\\n\"Look here, what\\'s going to happen when these two meet?\"\\n\\nI shook my head helplessly.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve told Mary to keep them apart if she can.\"\\n\\n\"Will she be able to do so?\"\\n\\n\"The Lord only knows. There\\'s one thing, Inglethorp himself won\\'t be too\\nkeen on meeting her.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got the keys still, haven\\'t you, Poirot?\" I asked, as we reached\\nthe door of the locked room.\\n\\nTaking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in. The\\nlawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him.\\n\\n\"My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I\\nbelieve,\" he said.\\n\\nPoirot drew out the small bunch of keys.\\n\\n\"Permit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.\"\\n\\n\"But it\\'s not locked now.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible!\"\\n\\n\"See.\" And John lifted the lid as he spoke.\\n\\n\"_Milles tonnerres!_\" cried Poirot, dumfounded. \"And I--who have both\\nthe keys in my pocket!\" He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he\\nstiffened. \"_Eh voilà une affaire!_ This lock has been forced.\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\nPoirot laid down the case again.\\n\\n\"But who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?\"\\nThese exclamations burst from us disjointedly.\\n\\nPoirot answered them categorically--almost mechanically.\\n\\n\"Who? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was\\nhere an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary\\nlock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.\"\\n\\nWe stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the\\nmantel-piece. He was outwardly calm, but I noticed his hands, which from\\nlong force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\\nthe mantel-piece, were shaking violently.\\n\\n\"See here, it was like this,\" he said at last. \"There was something in\\nthat case--some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still\\nenough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital\\nto him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\\nsignificance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,\\nof coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,\\nthus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have\\nbeen something of great importance.\"\\n\\n\"But what was it?\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. \"That, I do not know! A\\ndocument of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper Dorcas\\nsaw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I--\" his anger burst forth\\nfreely--\"miserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have behaved\\nlike an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I should\\nhave carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is gone. It is\\ndestroyed--but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance--we must leave\\nno stone unturned--\"\\n\\nHe rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I\\nhad sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the\\ntop of the stairs, he was out of sight.\\n\\nMary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down\\ninto the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.\\n\\n\"What has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings? He\\nhas just rushed past me like a mad bull.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s rather upset about something,\" I remarked feebly. I really did not\\nknow how much Poirot would wish me to disclose. As I saw a faint smile\\ngather on Mrs. Cavendish\\'s expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try and\\nturn the conversation by saying: \"They haven\\'t met yet, have they?\"\\n\\n\"Who?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.\"\\n\\nShe looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.\\n\\n\"Do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?\"\\n\\n\"Well, don\\'t you?\" I said, rather taken aback.\\n\\n\"No.\" She was smiling in her quiet way. \"I should like to see a good\\nflare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so\\nmuch, and saying so little.\"\\n\\n\"John doesn\\'t think so,\" I remarked. \"He\\'s anxious to keep them apart.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, John!\"\\n\\nSomething in her tone fired me, and I blurted out:\\n\\n\"Old John\\'s an awfully good sort.\"\\n\\nShe studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my great\\nsurprise:\\n\\n\"You are loyal to your friend. I like you for that.\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you my friend too?\"\\n\\n\"I am a very bad friend.\"\\n\\n\"Why do you say that?\"\\n\\n\"Because it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget all\\nabout them the next.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly\\nand not in the best of taste:\\n\\n\"Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!\"\\n\\nInstantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the impression\\nof a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real woman. Without\\na word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs, whilst I stood like\\nan idiot gaping after her.\\n\\nI was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I\\ncould hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that\\nmy diplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking\\nthe whole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one,\\ndoubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my\\nfriend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I\\nstepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost\\nimmediately. I drew him aside.\\n\\n\"My dear fellow,\" I said, \"is this wise? Surely you don\\'t want the whole\\nhouse to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into the\\ncriminal\\'s hands.\"\\n\\n\"You think so, Hastings?\"\\n\\n\"I am sure of it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.\"\\n\\n\"Good. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.\"\\n\\n\"Sure.\"\\n\\nHe looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I\\nstill thought my rebuke a just and wise one.\\n\\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"let us go, _mon ami_.\"\\n\\n\"You have finished here?\"\\n\\n\"For the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?\"\\n\\n\"Willingly.\"\\n\\nHe picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open\\nwindow in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and\\nPoirot stood aside to let her pass.\\n\\n\"Excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\" she turned inquiringly.\\n\\n\"Did you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s medicines?\"\\n\\nA slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Only her powders?\"\\n\\nThe flush deepened as Cynthia replied:\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.\"\\n\\n\"These?\"\\n\\nPoirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n\"Can you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?\"\\n\\n\"No, they were bromide powders.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.\"\\n\\nAs we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than\\nonce. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his eyes\\nturned green like a cat\\'s. They were shining like emeralds now.\\n\\n\"My friend,\" he broke out at last, \"I have a little idea, a very\\nstrange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet--it fits in.\"\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too\\nmuch given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth was\\nonly too plain and apparent.\\n\\n\"So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,\" I remarked.\\n\"Very simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it\\nmyself.\"\\n\\nPoirot did not appear to be listening to me.\\n\\n\"They have made one more discovery, la-bas,\" he observed, jerking his\\nthumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles. \"Mr. Wells told me\\nas we were going upstairs.\"\\n\\n\"What was it?\"\\n\\n\"Locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs.\\nInglethorp\\'s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred\\nInglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.\\nIt came quite as a surprise to Wells--and to John Cavendish also. It was\\nwritten on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the\\nservants--not Dorcas.\"\\n\\n\"Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?\"\\n\\n\"He says not.\"\\n\\n\"One might take that with a grain of salt,\" I remarked sceptically. \"All\\nthese wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled words\\non the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday\\nafternoon?\"\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n\"_Mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the\\nfact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, often. I suppose every one has.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or twice\\non the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to see if\\nit looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You will notice\\nthat the word \\'possessed\\' is spelt first with one \\'s\\' and subsequently\\nwith two--correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it in a\\nsentence, thus: \\'I am possessed.\\' Now, what did that tell me? It told\\nme that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word \\'possessed\\' that\\nafternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\\nin my mind, the possibility of a will--(a document almost certain\\nto contain that word)--occurred to me at once. This possibility was\\nconfirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the\\nboudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\\ntraces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine for\\nsome days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit.\\n\\n\"I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\\nbeen newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that on\\nthe floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they had been\\nplanted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly both\\nof the gardeners--for there were two sets of footprints in the bed--had\\nentered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished to speak\\nto them she would in all probability have stood at the window, and they\\nwould not have come into the room at all. I was now quite convinced\\nthat she had made a fresh will, and had called the two gardeners in\\nto witness her signature. Events proved that I was right in my\\nsupposition.\"\\n\\n\"That was very ingenious,\" I could not help admitting. \"I must confess\\nthat the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite\\nerroneous.\"\\n\\nHe smiled.\\n\\n\"You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good\\nservant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most\\nlikely.\"\\n\\n\"Another point--how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had\\nbeen lost?\"\\n\\n\"I did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You\\nobserved that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That\\nsuggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\\nkey-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would\\nat once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what was\\nobviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to the\\nhypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the lock\\nof the despatch-case.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"Alfred Inglethorp, without doubt.\"\\n\\nPoirot looked at me curiously.\\n\\n\"You are very sure of his guilt?\"\\n\\n\"Well, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\\nclearly.\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary,\" said Poirot quietly, \"there are several points in his\\nfavour.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, come now!\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I see only one.\"\\n\\n\"And that?\"\\n\\n\"That he was not in the house last night.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Bad shot!\\' as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to\\nmy mind tells against him.\"\\n\\n\"How is that?\"\\n\\n\"Because if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\\nnight, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house.\\nHis excuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two\\npossibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\\nreason of his own for his absence.\"\\n\\n\"And that reason?\" I asked sceptically.\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\"How should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp,\\nI should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel--but that does not of necessity\\nmake him a murderer.\"\\n\\nI shook my head, unconvinced.\\n\\n\"We do not agree, eh?\" said Poirot. \"Well, let us leave it. Time will\\nshow which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the case.\\nWhat do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom were\\nbolted on the inside?\"\\n\\n\"Well----\" I considered. \"One must look at it logically.\"\\n\\n\"True.\"\\n\\n\"I should put it this way. The doors _were_ bolted--our own eyes have\\ntold us that--yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and\\nthe destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone entered\\nthe room. You agree so far?\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" I said, encouraged, \"as the person who entered did not do so by\\nthe window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have\\nbeen opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens\\nthe conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would\\nnaturally open the door to her own husband.\"\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n\"Why should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room--a most\\nunusual proceeding on her part--she had had a most violent quarrel with\\nhim that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.\"\\n\\n\"But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs.\\nInglethorp herself?\"\\n\\n\"There is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door\\ninto the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\\nmorning, and bolted it then.\"\\n\\n\"Poirot, is that seriously your opinion?\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another\\nfeature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\\nbetween Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?\"\\n\\n\"I had forgotten that,\" I said thoughtfully. \"That is as enigmatical as\\never. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and\\nreticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\\ncertainly not her affair.\"\\n\\n\"Precisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\\ndo.\"\\n\\n\"It is certainly curious,\" I agreed. \"Still, it is unimportant, and need\\nnot be taken into account.\"\\n\\nA groan burst from Poirot.\\n\\n\"What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If\\nthe fact will not fit the theory--let the theory go.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we shall see,\" I said, nettled.\\n\\n\"Yes, we shall see.\"\\n\\nWe had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his\\nown room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself\\noccasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the used\\nmatches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary annoyance\\nvanished.\\n\\nPoirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\\ncommanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and\\npleasant. It was going to be a hot day.\\n\\nSuddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\\ndown the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that\\nwas extraordinary--a curious mingling of terror and agitation.\\n\\n\"Look, Poirot!\" I said.\\n\\nHe leant forward.\\n\\n\"_Tiens!_\" he said. \"It is Mr. Mace, from the chemist\\'s shop. He is\\ncoming here.\"\\n\\nThe young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after\\nhesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.\\n\\n\"A little minute,\" cried Poirot from the window. \"I come.\"\\n\\nMotioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and opened\\nthe door. Mr. Mace began at once.\\n\\n\"Oh, Mr. Poirot, I\\'m sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that you\\'d\\njust come back from the Hall?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we have.\"\\n\\nThe young man moistened his dry lips. His face was working curiously.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly.\\nThey do say--\" he lowered his voice cautiously--\"that it\\'s poison?\"\\n\\nPoirot\\'s face remained quite impassive.\\n\\n\"Only the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, exactly--of course----\" The young man hesitated, and then his\\nagitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank\\nhis voice to a whisper: \"Just tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn\\'t--it\\nisn\\'t strychnine, is it?\"\\n\\nI hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a\\nnon-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door\\nPoirot\\'s eyes met mine.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said, nodding gravely. \"He will have evidence to give at the\\ninquest.\"\\n\\nWe went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot\\nstopped me with a gesture of his hand.\\n\\n\"Not now, not now, _mon ami_. I have need of reflection. My mind is in\\nsome disorder--which is not well.\"\\n\\nFor about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except\\nfor several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his\\neyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh.\\n\\n\"It is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and\\nclassified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear\\nyet--no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles _me_. _Me_,\\nHercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.\"\\n\\n\"And what are they?\"\\n\\n\"The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very\\nimportant.\"\\n\\n\"But it was a glorious day!\" I interrupted. \"Poirot, you\\'re pulling my\\nleg!\"\\n\\n\"Not at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not\\nforget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!\"\\n\\n\"And the second point?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar\\nclothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.\"\\n\\n\"Poirot, I cannot believe you are serious.\"\\n\\n\"I am absolutely serious, my friend.\"\\n\\n\"But this is childish!\"\\n\\n\"No, it is very momentous.\"\\n\\n\"And supposing the Coroner\\'s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder\\nagainst Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?\"\\n\\n\"They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to make\\na mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury is not\\nanxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp stands\\npractically in the position of local squire. Also,\" he added placidly,\\n\"_I_ should not allow it!\"\\n\\n\"_You_ would not allow it?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\nI looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and\\namusement. He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my\\nthoughts, he nodded gently.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, _mon ami_, I would do what I say.\" He got up and laid his hand\\non my shoulder. His physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears\\ncame into his eyes. \"In all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs.\\nInglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly loved--no. But she was\\nvery good to us Belgians--I owe her a debt.\"\\n\\nI endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.\\n\\n\"Let me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let\\nAlfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_--when a word from me\\ncould save him!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. THE INQUEST\\n\\nIn the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his\\nactivity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long\\nwalks into the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his\\nconfidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was\\ndriving at.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes\\'s\\nfarm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on\\nWednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet\\nhim. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to the\\nfarm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at me\\ncunningly.\\n\\n\"You\\'m from the Hall, bain\\'t you?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes. I\\'m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked\\nthis way.\"\\n\\n\"A little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies\\nfrom the village?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I said eagerly. \"He has been here, then?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, ay, he\\'s been here, right enough. More\\'n once too. Friend of yours,\\nis he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall--you\\'n a pretty lot!\" And he\\nleered more jocosely than ever.\\n\\n\"Why, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?\" I asked, as\\ncarelessly as I could.\\n\\nHe winked at me knowingly.\\n\\n\"_One_ does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal gentleman\\ntoo! Oh, thank you, sir, I\\'m sure.\"\\n\\nI walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I\\nexperienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred\\nInglethorp\\'s liberality with another woman\\'s money. Had that piquant\\ngipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser\\nmainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both.\\n\\nOn one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or\\ntwice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in\\nfixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it\\nwas 4.30, and not 4 o\\'clock when she had heard the voices.\\n\\nBut Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed\\nbetween the time when she had heard the voices and 5 o\\'clock, when she\\nhad taken tea to her mistress.\\n\\nThe inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.\\nPoirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.\\n\\nThe preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John\\nCavendish gave evidence of identification.\\n\\nFurther questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of the\\nmorning, and the circumstances of his mother\\'s death.\\n\\nThe medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and\\nevery eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to be\\none of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of toxicology.\\n\\nIn a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn\\nof its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\\npoisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken\\nnot less than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one\\ngrain or slightly over.\\n\\n\"Is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?\"\\nasked the Coroner.\\n\\n\"I should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for domestic\\npurposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions placed on its\\nsale.\"\\n\\n\"Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\\nwas administered?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?\"\\n\\n\"That is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I\\nhurried there as fast as I could.\"\\n\\n\"Will you relate to us exactly what happened next?\"\\n\\n\"I entered Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s room. She was at that moment in a\\ntypical tetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out:\\n\\'Alfred--Alfred----\\'\"\\n\\n\"Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s\\nafter-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?\"\\n\\n\"Possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The\\nsymptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It\\nis retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear\\nto have been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the\\ncoffee after dinner about eight o\\'clock, whereas the symptoms did not\\nmanifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on\\nthe face of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the\\nevening.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\\nmiddle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in\\nthat?\"\\n\\n\"No, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\\nhad it analysed. There was no strychnine present.\"\\n\\nI heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.\\n\\n\"How did you know?\" I whispered.\\n\\n\"Listen.\"\\n\\n\"I should say\"--the doctor was continuing--\"that I would have been\\nconsiderably surprised at any other result.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be\\ndetected in a solution of 1 in 70,000, and can only be disguised by some\\nstrongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite powerless to mask\\nit.\"\\n\\nOne of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.\\n\\n\"No. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover the\\ntaste of strychnine.\"\\n\\n\"Then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\\ncoffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of\\nanalyzing its contents.\"\\n\\nThis concluded Dr. Bauerstein\\'s evidence. Dr. Wilkins corroborated it on\\nall points. Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated\\nit utterly. The deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart,\\nbut otherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and\\nwell-balanced disposition. She would be one of the last people to take\\nher own life.\\n\\nLawrence Cavendish was next called. His evidence was quite unimportant,\\nbeing a mere repetition of that of his brother. Just as he was about to\\nstep down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:\\n\\n\"I should like to make a suggestion if I may?\"\\n\\nHe glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner, who replied briskly:\\n\\n\"Certainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this\\nmatter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.\"\\n\\n\"It is just an idea of mine,\" explained Lawrence. \"Of course I may be\\nquite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother\\'s death might be\\naccounted for by natural means.\"\\n\\n\"How do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?\"\\n\\n\"My mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was\\ntaking a tonic containing strychnine.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said the Coroner.\\n\\nThe jury looked up, interested.\\n\\n\"I believe,\" continued Lawrence, \"that there have been cases where the\\ncumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended\\nby causing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\\noverdose of her medicine by accident?\"\\n\\n\"This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\\nthe time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.\"\\n\\nDr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.\\n\\n\"What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell\\nyou the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,\\nbut it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\\nthis way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms which\\nwould at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is absurd.\"\\n\\n\"And the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently\\ntaken an overdose?\"\\n\\n\"Three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs.\\nInglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\\ntime, as she dealt with Coot\\'s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She\\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\\namount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.\"\\n\\n\"Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any way\\ninstrumental in causing her death?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. The supposition is ridiculous.\"\\n\\nThe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\\n\\n\"That, of course, is always possible,\" replied the doctor.\\n\\nBut Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\\npossibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary,\\nMrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\\n\\nSo the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner\\nproceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had\\nbeen awakened by the violent ringing of her mistress\\'s bell, and had\\nsubsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.\\n\\nDorcas\\'s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had\\nalready heard, so I will not repeat it here.\\n\\nThe next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and\\nspoke in a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the\\nCoroner\\'s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\\n4.30 as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the sound of\\nsomething heavy falling.\\n\\n\"That would have been the table by the bed?\" commented the Coroner.\\n\\n\"I opened my door,\" continued Mary, \"and listened. In a few minutes a\\nbell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\\nwe all went to my mother-in-law\\'s room, but it was locked----\"\\n\\nThe Coroner interrupted her.\\n\\n\"I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We\\nknow all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should\\nbe obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the day\\nbefore.\"\\n\\n\"I?\"\\n\\nThere was a faint insolence in her voice. She raised her hand and\\nadjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as\\nshe did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:\\n\"She is gaining time!\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I understand,\" continued the Coroner deliberately, \"that you\\nwere sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\\nboudoir. That is so, is it not?\"\\n\\nThis was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it\\nwas news to him as well.\\n\\nThere was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before\\nshe answered:\\n\\n\"Yes, that is so.\"\\n\\n\"And the boudoir window was open, was it not?\"\\n\\nSurely her face grew a little paler as she answered:\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as\\nthey were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where you\\nwere than in the hall.\"\\n\\n\"Possibly.\"\\n\\n\"Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?\"\\n\\n\"I really do not remember hearing anything.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean to say you did not hear voices?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.\" A\\nfaint spot of colour came into her cheek. \"I am not in the habit of\\nlistening to private conversations.\"\\n\\nThe Coroner persisted.\\n\\n\"And you remember nothing at all? _Nothing_, Mrs. Cavendish? Not\\none stray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private\\nconversation?\"\\n\\nShe paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.\\n\\n\"Yes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said something--I do not remember\\nexactly what--about causing scandal between husband and wife.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" the Coroner leant back satisfied. \"That corresponds with what\\nDorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it\\nwas a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where\\nyou were?\"\\n\\nI caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them.\\nI felt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\\nlittle lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\\nquietly enough:\\n\\n\"No. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.\"\\n\\n\"And that is all you can tell us?\"\\n\\n\"That is all.\"\\n\\nThe examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely\\nsatisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell\\nmore if she chose.\\n\\nAmy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a\\nwill form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener\\nat Styles.\\n\\nWilliam Earl and Manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing\\na document. Manning fixed the time at about 4.30, William was of the\\nopinion that it was rather earlier.\\n\\nCynthia Murdoch came next. She had, however, little to tell. She had\\nknown nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\n\"You did not hear the table fall?\"\\n\\n\"No. I was fast asleep.\"\\n\\nThe Coroner smiled.\\n\\n\"A good conscience makes a sound sleeper,\" he observed. \"Thank you, Miss\\nMurdoch, that is all.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Howard.\"\\n\\nMiss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on\\nthe evening of the 17th. Poirot and I had, of course already seen it.\\nIt added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. The following is a\\nfacsimile:\\n\\n\\n                                             STYLES COURT\\n                               ESSEX hand written note:  July 17th\\n\\nMy dear Evelyn\\n\\n     Can we not bury the hachet? I have found it hard to forgive the\\n     things you said against my dear husband but I am an old woman\\n  and very fond of you\\n\\n     Yours affectionately,\\n\\n          Emily Inglethorpe\\n\\nIt was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.\\n\\n\"I fear it does not help us much,\" said the Coroner, with a sigh. \"There\\nis no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"Plain as a pikestaff to me,\" said Miss Howard shortly. \"It shows\\nclearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she\\'d been\\nmade a fool of!\"\\n\\n\"It says nothing of the kind in the letter,\" the Coroner pointed out.\\n\\n\"No, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But I\\nknow her. She wanted me back. But she wasn\\'t going to own that I\\'d\\nbeen right. She went round about. Most people do. Don\\'t believe in it\\nmyself.\"\\n\\nMr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury. Miss\\nHoward was obviously quite a public character.\\n\\n\"Anyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,\" continued the\\nlady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. \"Talk--talk--talk!\\nWhen all the time we know perfectly well----\"\\n\\nThe Coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:\\n\\n\"Thank you, Miss Howard, that is all.\"\\n\\nI fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.\\n\\nThen came the sensation of the day. The Coroner called Albert Mace,\\nchemist\\'s assistant.\\n\\nIt was our agitated young man of the pale face. In answer to the\\nCoroner\\'s questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,\\nbut had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant\\nformerly there had just been called up for the army.\\n\\nThese preliminaries completed, the Coroner proceeded to business.\\n\\n\"Mr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"When was this?\"\\n\\n\"Last Monday night.\"\\n\\n\"Monday? Not Tuesday?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, Monday, the 16th.\"\\n\\n\"Will you tell us to whom you sold it?\"\\n\\nYou could have heard a pin drop.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. It was to Mr. Inglethorp.\"\\n\\nEvery eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting,\\nimpassive and wooden. He started slightly, as the damning words fell\\nfrom the young man\\'s lips. I half thought he was going to rise from\\nhis chair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted\\nexpression of astonishment rose on his face.\\n\\n\"You are sure of what you say?\" asked the Coroner sternly.\\n\\n\"Quite sure, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\\ncounter?\"\\n\\nThe wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner\\'s frown.\\n\\n\"Oh, no, sir--of course not. But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the\\nHall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a\\ndog.\"\\n\\nInwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please\\n\"The Hall\"--especially when it might result in custom being transferred\\nfrom Coot\\'s to the local establishment.\\n\\n\"Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.\"\\n\\n\"Have you got the book here?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\nIt was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner\\ndismissed the wretched Mr. Mace.\\n\\nThen, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he\\nrealize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his\\nneck?\\n\\nThe Coroner went straight to the point.\\n\\n\"On Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\\npoisoning a dog?\"\\n\\nInglethorp replied with perfect calmness:\\n\\n\"No, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,\\nwhich is in perfect health.\"\\n\\n\"You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on\\nMonday last?\"\\n\\n\"I do.\"\\n\\n\"Do you also deny _this_?\"\\n\\nThe Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\\ninscribed.\\n\\n\"Certainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will\\nshow you.\"\\n\\nHe took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,\\nhanding it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar.\\n\\n\"Then what is your explanation of Mr. Mace\\'s statement?\"\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably:\\n\\n\"Mr. Mace must have been mistaken.\"\\n\\nThe Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\\n\\n\"Mr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\\nwhere you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?\"\\n\\n\"Really--I can\\'t remember.\"\\n\\n\"That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,\" said the Coroner sharply. \"Think\\nagain.\"\\n\\nInglethorp shook his head.\\n\\n\"I cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.\"\\n\\n\"In what direction?\"\\n\\n\"I really can\\'t remember.\"\\n\\nThe Coroner\\'s face grew graver.\\n\\n\"Were you in company with anyone?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Did you meet anyone on your walk?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"That is a pity,\" said the Coroner dryly. \"I am to take it then that\\nyou decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively\\nrecognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?\"\\n\\n\"If you like to take it that way, yes.\"\\n\\n\"Be careful, Mr. Inglethorp.\"\\n\\nPoirot was fidgeting nervously.\\n\\n\"_Sacre!_\" he murmured. \"Does this imbecile of a man _want_ to be\\narrested?\"\\n\\nInglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials\\nwould not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly\\nto the next point, and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief.\\n\\n\"You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me,\" interrupted Alfred Inglethorp, \"you have been misinformed.\\nI had no quarrel with my dear wife. The whole story is absolutely\\nuntrue. I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"Have you anyone who can testify to that?\"\\n\\n\"You have my word,\" said Inglethorp haughtily.\\n\\nThe Coroner did not trouble to reply.\\n\\n\"There are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\\ndisagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.\"\\n\\n\"Those witnesses were mistaken.\"\\n\\nI was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was\\nstaggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation\\non his face which I could not understand. Was he at last convinced of\\nAlfred Inglethorp\\'s guilt?\\n\\n\"Mr. Inglethorp,\" said the Coroner, \"you have heard your wife\\'s dying\\nwords repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly I can.\"\\n\\n\"You can?\"\\n\\n\"It seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein\\nis much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim\\nlight, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" murmured Poirot to himself. \"But it is an idea, that!\"\\n\\n\"You think it is true?\" I whispered.\\n\\n\"I do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition.\"\\n\\n\"You read my wife\\'s last words as an accusation\"--Inglethorp was\\ncontinuing--\"they were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.\"\\n\\nThe Coroner reflected a moment, then he said:\\n\\n\"I believe, Mr. Inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee, and\\ntook it to your wife that evening?\"\\n\\n\"I poured it out, yes. But I did not take it to her. I meant to do so,\\nbut I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the\\ncoffee on the hall table. When I came through the hall again a few\\nminutes later, it was gone.\"\\n\\nThis statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me\\nto improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he had had ample\\ntime to introduce the poison.\\n\\nAt that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who\\nwere sitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark,\\nferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.\\n\\nI questioned Poirot mutely. He put his lips to my ear.\\n\\n\"Do you know who that little man is?\"\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n\"That is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard--Jimmy Japp.\\nThe other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my\\nfriend.\"\\n\\nI stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the\\npoliceman about them. I should never have suspected them of being\\nofficial personages.\\n\\nI was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict\\nbeing given:\\n\\n\"Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. POIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS\\n\\nAs we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle\\npressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the\\nScotland Yard men.\\n\\nIn a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and\\naccosted the shorter of the two.\\n\\n\"I fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.\"\\n\\n\"Why, if it isn\\'t Mr. Poirot!\" cried the Inspector. He turned to the\\nother man. \"You\\'ve heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and I\\nworked together--the Abercrombie forgery case--you remember, he was\\nrun down in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you\\nremember \\'Baron\\' Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded\\nthe clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in\\nAntwerp--thanks to Mr. Poirot here.\"\\n\\nAs these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer,\\nand was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn,\\nintroduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.\\n\\n\"I need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,\" remarked Poirot.\\n\\nJapp closed one eye knowingly.\\n\\n\"No, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say.\"\\n\\nBut Poirot answered gravely:\\n\\n\"There I differ from you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, come!\" said Summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.\\n\"Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man\\'s caught\\nred-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!\"\\n\\nBut Japp was looking attentively at Poirot.\\n\\n\"Hold your fire, Summerhaye,\" he remarked jocularly. \"Me and Moosier\\nhere have met before--and there\\'s no man\\'s judgment I\\'d sooner take\\nthan his. If I\\'m not greatly mistaken, he\\'s got something up his sleeve.\\nIsn\\'t that so, moosier?\"\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n\"I have drawn certain conclusions--yes.\"\\n\\nSummerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his\\nscrutiny of Poirot.\\n\\n\"It\\'s this way,\" he said, \"so far, we\\'ve only seen the case from the\\noutside. That\\'s where the Yard\\'s at a disadvantage in a case of this\\nkind, where the murder\\'s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A lot\\ndepends on being on the spot first thing, and that\\'s where Mr. Poirot\\'s\\nhad the start of us. We shouldn\\'t have been here as soon as this even,\\nif it hadn\\'t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor on the\\nspot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you\\'ve been on the\\nspot from the first, and you may have picked up some little hints. From\\nthe evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife as sure as\\nI stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary I\\'d laugh in\\nhis face. I must say I was surprised the jury didn\\'t bring it in Wilful\\nMurder against him right off. I think they would have, if it hadn\\'t been\\nfor the Coroner--he seemed to be holding them back.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket now,\"\\nsuggested Poirot.\\n\\nA kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp\\'s expressive\\ncountenance.\\n\\n\"Perhaps I have, and perhaps I haven\\'t,\" he remarked dryly.\\n\\nPoirot looked at him thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"I am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say,\" observed Summerhaye sarcastically.\\n\\nJapp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A wink\\'s as good as a\\nnod--from you. You\\'ve been on the spot--and the Yard doesn\\'t want to\\nmake any mistakes, you know.\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded gravely.\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your\\nwarrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos--the case\\nagainst him will be dismissed at once! _Comme ça!_\" And he snapped his\\nfingers expressively.\\n\\nJapp\\'s face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.\\n\\nAs for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only conclude\\nthat Poirot was mad.\\n\\nJapp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.\\n\\n\"I daren\\'t do it, Mr. Poirot. I\\'d take your word, but there\\'s others\\nover me who\\'ll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Can\\'t you give me\\na little more to go on?\"\\n\\nPoirot reflected a moment.\\n\\n\"It can be done,\" he said at last. \"I admit I do not wish it. It\\nforces my hand. I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\\npresent, but what you say is very just--the word of a Belgian policeman,\\nwhose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be\\narrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See,\\nthen, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?\"\\n\\n\"Well, in about half an hour. We\\'re seeing the Coroner and the doctor\\nfirst.\"\\n\\n\"Good. Call for me in passing--the last house in the village. I will go\\nwith you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses--as\\nis probable--I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\\ncase against him could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a bargain,\" said Japp heartily. \"And, on behalf of the Yard, I\\'m\\nmuch obliged to you, though I\\'m bound to confess I can\\'t at present see\\nthe faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always were a\\nmarvel! So long, then, moosier.\"\\n\\nThe two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\\nhis face.\\n\\n\"Well, my friend,\" cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, \"what do\\nyou think? _Mon Dieu!_ I had some warm moments in that court; I did not\\nfigure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to say\\nanything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,\" I\\nremarked. \"For, if the case against him is true, how could he defend\\nhimself except by silence?\"\\n\\n\"Why, in a thousand ingenious ways,\" cried Poirot. \"See; say that it is\\nI who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible\\nstories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp\\'s stony denials!\"\\n\\nI could not help laughing.\\n\\n\"My dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy!\\nBut, seriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you\\nsurely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp\\'s\\ninnocence?\"\\n\\n\"Why not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.\"\\n\\n\"But the evidence is so conclusive.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, too conclusive.\"\\n\\nWe turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now\\nfamiliar stairs.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, too conclusive,\" continued Poirot, almost to himself.\\n\"Real evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be\\nexamined--sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my\\nfriend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured--so cleverly\\nthat it has defeated its own ends.\"\\n\\n\"How do you make that out?\"\\n\\n\"Because, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,\\nit was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has\\ndrawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.\"\\n\\nI was silent. And in a minute or two, Poirot continued:\\n\\n\"Let us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who\\nsets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying\\ngoes. Presumably, therefore, he has some wits. He is not altogether\\na fool. Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village\\nchemist\\'s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped up\\nstory about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not employ\\nthe poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent quarrel\\nwith her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which naturally\\ndirects their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence--no shadow\\nof an alibi, yet he knows the chemist\\'s assistant must necessarily come\\nforward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe that any man could\\nbe so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit suicide by causing\\nhimself to be hanged, would act so!\"\\n\\n\"Still--I do not see--\" I began.\\n\\n\"Neither do I see. I tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _Me_--Hercule\\nPoirot!\"\\n\\n\"But if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the\\nstrychnine?\"\\n\\n\"Very simply. He did _not_ buy it.\"\\n\\n\"But Mace recognized him!\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr.\\nInglethorp\\'s, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in\\nMr. Inglethorp\\'s rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a man\\nwhom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you remember, he\\nhimself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs. Inglethorp\\ndealt principally with Coot\\'s in Tadminster.\"\\n\\n\"Then you think----\"\\n\\n\"_Mon ami_, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave the\\nfirst one for the moment, what was the second?\"\\n\\n\"The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has a\\nblack beard, and uses glasses,\" I quoted.\\n\\n\"Exactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or\\nLawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I said thoughtfully. \"Of course an actor----\"\\n\\nBut Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.\\n\\n\"And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they\\nare both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these\\ntwo in broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain\\ninitial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all\\nthat is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his\\neyes--those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now,\\nwhat is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from\\nhimself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it\\non someone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.\\nEverybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp\\'s guilt. It was\\na foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a sure\\nthing there must be tangible proof--such as the actual buying of\\nthe poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr.\\nInglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never\\nactually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in\\nhis clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred Inglethorp?\"\\n\\n\"It may be so,\" I said, fascinated by Poirot\\'s eloquence. \"But, if that\\nwas the case, why does he not say where he was at six o\\'clock on Monday\\nevening?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, why indeed?\" said Poirot, calming down. \"If he were arrested, he\\nprobably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make\\nhim see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something\\ndiscreditable behind his silence. If he did not murder his wife, he\\nis, nevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,\\nquite apart from the murder.\"\\n\\n\"What can it be?\" I mused, won over to Poirot\\'s views for the moment,\\nalthough still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\\nwas the correct one.\\n\\n\"Can you not guess?\" asked Poirot, smiling.\\n\\n\"No, can you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I had a little idea sometime ago--and it has turned out to be\\ncorrect.\"\\n\\n\"You never told me,\" I said reproachfully.\\n\\nPoirot spread out his hands apologetically.\\n\\n\"Pardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.\" He turned\\nto me earnestly. \"Tell me--you see now that he must not be arrested?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the\\nfate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him\\nno harm.\\n\\nPoirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.\\n\\n\"Come, my friend,\" he said, changing the subject, \"apart from Mr.\\nInglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, pretty much what I expected.\"\\n\\n\"Did nothing strike you as peculiar about it?\"\\n\\nMy thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish, and I hedged:\\n\\n\"In what way?\"\\n\\n\"Well, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\\'s evidence for instance?\"\\n\\nI was relieved.\\n\\n\"Oh, Lawrence! No, I don\\'t think so. He\\'s always a nervous chap.\"\\n\\n\"His suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally by\\nmeans of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as strange--\\n_hein?_\"\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was\\nquite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.\"\\n\\n\"But Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he had\\nstarted by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s true. I never thought of that.\" I was rather startled. \"It\\n_is_ odd.\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\"From the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household,\\nhe alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\\npoisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\\nstrenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had\\nbeen Monsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical\\nknowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence--no!\\nAnd now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\\nknown was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s very confusing,\" I agreed.\\n\\n\"Then there is Mrs. Cavendish,\" continued Poirot. \"That\\'s another who is\\nnot telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she should\\nbe shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded reflectively.\\n\\n\"Yes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more\\nof that \\'private conversation\\' than she was willing to admit.\"\\n\\n\"And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\\neavesdrop!\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. One thing her evidence _has_ shown me. I made a mistake.\\nDorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the\\nafternoon, about four o\\'clock, as she said.\"\\n\\nI looked at him curiously. I had never understood his insistence on that\\npoint.\\n\\n\"Yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,\" continued Poirot.\\n\"Dr. Bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour in\\nthe morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact.\"\\n\\n\"He has insomnia, I believe,\" I said doubtfully.\\n\\n\"Which is a very good, or a very bad explanation,\" remarked Poirot.\\n\"It covers everything, and explains nothing. I shall keep my eye on our\\nclever Dr. Bauerstein.\"\\n\\n\"Any more faults to find with the evidence?\" I inquired satirically.\\n\\n\"_Mon ami_,\" replied Poirot gravely, \"when you find that people are not\\ntelling you the truth--look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the\\ninquest to-day only one--at most, two persons were speaking the truth\\nwithout reservation or subterfuge.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, come now, Poirot! I won\\'t cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But\\nthere\\'s John--and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?\"\\n\\n\"Both of them, my friend? One, I grant you, but both----!\"\\n\\nHis words gave me an unpleasant shock. Miss Howard\\'s evidence,\\nunimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright\\nstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\\nsincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirot\\'s sagacity--except\\non the occasions when he was what I described to myself as \"foolishly\\npig-headed.\"\\n\\n\"Do you really think so?\" I asked. \"Miss Howard had always seemed to me\\nso essentially honest--almost uncomfortably so.\"\\n\\nPoirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He seemed\\nto speak, and then checked himself.\\n\\n\"Miss Murdoch too,\" I continued, \"there\\'s nothing untruthful about\\n_her_.\"\\n\\n\"No. But it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next\\ndoor; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building,\\ndistinctly heard the table fall.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she\\'s young. And she sleeps soundly.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes, indeed! She must be a famous sleeper, that one!\"\\n\\nI did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart\\nknock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the\\ntwo detectives waiting for us below.\\n\\nPoirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,\\ncarefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned\\nme to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and\\nset out for Styles.\\n\\nI think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a\\nshock--especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had\\nrealized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the\\ndetectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\\nhave done.\\n\\nPoirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it\\nwas the latter functionary who requested that the household, with\\nthe exception of the servants, should be assembled together in the\\ndrawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot\\nto make his boast good.\\n\\nPersonally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons\\nfor his belief in Inglethorp\\'s innocence, but a man of the type of\\nSummerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot\\ncould supply.\\n\\nBefore very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door\\nof which Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for every one. The\\nScotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for\\nthe first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a\\ntangible reality. We had read of such things--now we ourselves were\\nactors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England, would\\nblazon out the news in staring headlines:\\n\\n\\n          \"MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX\"\\n\\n          \"WEALTHY LADY POISONED\"\\n\\nThere would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of \"The family leaving\\nthe Inquest\"--the village photographer had not been idle! All the things\\nthat one had read a hundred times--things that happen to other people,\\nnot to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In\\nfront of us were \"the detectives in charge of the case.\" The well-known\\nglib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\\nPoirot opened the proceedings.\\n\\nI think every one was a little surprised that it should be he and not\\none of the official detectives who took the initiative.\\n\\n\"_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_,\" said Poirot, bowing as though he were a\\ncelebrity about to deliver a lecture, \"I have asked you to come here\\nall together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred\\nInglethorp.\"\\n\\nInglethorp was sitting a little by himself--I think, unconsciously,\\nevery one had drawn his chair slightly away from him--and he gave a\\nfaint start as Poirot pronounced his name.\\n\\n\"Mr. Inglethorp,\" said Poirot, addressing him directly, \"a very dark\\nshadow is resting on this house--the shadow of murder.\"\\n\\nInglethorp shook his head sadly.\\n\\n\"My poor wife,\" he murmured. \"Poor Emily! It is terrible.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think, monsieur,\" said Poirot pointedly, \"that you quite\\nrealize how terrible it may be--for you.\" And as Inglethorp did not\\nappear to understand, he added: \"Mr. Inglethorp, you are standing in\\nvery grave danger.\"\\n\\nThe two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution \"Anything\\nyou say will be used in evidence against you,\" actually hovering on\\nSummerhaye\\'s lips. Poirot went on.\\n\\n\"Do you understand now, monsieur?\"\\n\\n\"No; What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I mean,\" said Poirot deliberately, \"that you are suspected of poisoning\\nyour wife.\"\\n\\nA little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Inglethorp, starting up. \"What a monstrous idea!\\n_I_--poison my dearest Emily!\"\\n\\n\"I do not think\"--Poirot watched him narrowly--\"that you quite realize\\nthe unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. Mr. Inglethorp,\\nknowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to say where you\\nwere at six o\\'clock on Monday afternoon?\"\\n\\nWith a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\\nhis hands. Poirot approached and stood over him.\\n\\n\"Speak!\" he cried menacingly.\\n\\nWith an effort, Inglethorp raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly\\nand deliberately, he shook his head.\\n\\n\"You will not speak?\"\\n\\n\"No. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\\nof what you say.\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.\\n\\n\"_Soit!_\" he said. \"Then I must speak for you.\"\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp sprang up again.\\n\\n\"You? How can you speak? You do not know----\" he broke off abruptly.\\n\\nPoirot turned to face us. \"_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_! I speak! Listen!\\nI, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist\\'s shop,\\nand purchased strychnine at six o\\'clock on Monday last was not Mr.\\nInglethorp, for at six o\\'clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting\\nMrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no\\nless than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either\\nat six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs. Raikes\\'s\\nhome, is at least two and a half miles distant from the village. There\\nis absolutely no question as to the alibi!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. FRESH SUSPICIONS\\n\\nThere was a moment\\'s stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least\\nsurprised of any of us, was the first to speak.\\n\\n\"My word,\" he cried, \"you\\'re the goods! And no mistake, Mr. Poirot!\\nThese witnesses of yours are all right, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"_Voilà!_ I have prepared a list of them--names and addresses. You must\\nsee them, of course. But you will find it all right.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure of that.\" Japp lowered his voice. \"I\\'m much obliged to you.\\nA pretty mare\\'s nest arresting him would have been.\" He turned to\\nInglethorp. \"But, if you\\'ll excuse me, sir, why couldn\\'t you say all\\nthis at the inquest?\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you why,\" interrupted Poirot. \"There was a certain\\nrumour----\"\\n\\n\"A most malicious and utterly untrue one,\" interrupted Alfred Inglethorp\\nin an agitated voice.\\n\\n\"And Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\\npresent. Am I right?\"\\n\\n\"Quite right.\" Inglethorp nodded. \"With my poor Emily not yet buried,\\ncan you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\\nstarted.\"\\n\\n\"Between you and me, sir,\" remarked Japp, \"I\\'d sooner have any amount\\nof rumours than be arrested for murder. And I venture to think your poor\\nlady would have felt the same. And, if it hadn\\'t been for Mr. Poirot\\nhere, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!\"\\n\\n\"I was foolish, no doubt,\" murmured Inglethorp. \"But you do not know,\\ninspector, how I have been persecuted and maligned.\" And he shot a\\nbaleful glance at Evelyn Howard.\\n\\n\"Now, sir,\" said Japp, turning briskly to John, \"I should like to see\\nthe lady\\'s bedroom, please, and after that I\\'ll have a little chat with\\nthe servants. Don\\'t you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will\\nshow me the way.\"\\n\\nAs they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to\\nfollow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.\\n\\n\"Quick, go to the other wing. Stand there--just this side of the baize\\ndoor. Do not move till I come.\" Then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the\\ntwo detectives.\\n\\nI followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,\\nand wondering what on earth lay behind the request. Why was I to\\nstand in this particular spot on guard? I looked thoughtfully down\\nthe corridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of\\nCynthia Murdoch\\'s, every one\\'s room was in this left wing. Had that\\nanything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood\\nfaithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing\\nhappened.\\n\\nIt must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me.\\n\\n\"You have not stirred?\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'ve stuck here like a rock. Nothing\\'s happened.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" Was he pleased, or disappointed? \"You\\'ve seen nothing at all?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"But you have probably heard something? A big bump--eh, _mon ami?_\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Is it possible? Ah, but I am vexed with myself! I am not usually\\nclumsy. I made but a slight gesture\"--I know Poirot\\'s gestures--\"with\\nthe left hand, and over went the table by the bed!\"\\n\\nHe looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to\\nconsole him.\\n\\n\"Never mind, old chap. What does it matter? Your triumph downstairs\\nexcited you. I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. There must\\nbe more in this affair of Inglethorp\\'s with Mrs. Raikes than we thought,\\nto make him hold his tongue so persistently. What are you going to do\\nnow? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?\"\\n\\n\"Gone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I\\nam disappointed in Japp. He has no method!\"\\n\\n\"Hullo!\" I said, looking out of the window. \"Here\\'s Dr. Bauerstein. I\\nbelieve you\\'re right about that man, Poirot. I don\\'t like him.\"\\n\\n\"He is clever,\" observed Poirot meditatively.\\n\\n\"Oh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the\\nplight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!\" And\\nI described the doctor\\'s adventure. \"He looked a regular scarecrow!\\nPlastered with mud from head to foot.\"\\n\\n\"You saw him, then?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Of course, he didn\\'t want to come in--it was just after\\ndinner--but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. \"Was Dr. Bauerstein\\nhere on Tuesday evening? Here? And you never told me? Why did you not\\ntell me? Why? Why?\"\\n\\nHe appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.\\n\\n\"My dear Poirot,\" I expostulated, \"I never thought it would interest\\nyou. I didn\\'t know it was of any importance.\"\\n\\n\"Importance? It is of the first importance! So Dr. Bauerstein was here\\non Tuesday night--the night of the murder. Hastings, do you not see?\\nThat alters everything--everything!\"\\n\\nI had never seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, he mechanically\\nstraightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to himself: \"Yes,\\nthat alters everything--everything.\"\\n\\nSuddenly he seemed to come to a decision.\\n\\n\"_Allons!_\" he said. \"We must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish?\"\\n\\nJohn was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him.\\n\\n\"Mr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new\\nclue. May I take your motor?\"\\n\\n\"Why, of course. Do you mean at once?\"\\n\\n\"If you please.\"\\n\\nJohn rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes,\\nwe were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.\\n\\n\"Now, Poirot,\" I remarked resignedly, \"perhaps you will tell me what all\\nthis is about?\"\\n\\n\"Well, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you\\nrealize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is\\ngreatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We\\nknow now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have\\ncleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have\\nascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs.\\nCavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr.\\nInglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement\\nthat he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of that\\nat the inquest--but now it has a very different significance. We must\\nfind out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually, or who\\npassed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your account,\\nthere are only two people whom we can positively say did not go near the\\ncoffee--Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that is so.\" I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart. Mary\\nCavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.\\n\\n\"In clearing Alfred Inglethorp,\" continued Poirot, \"I have been obliged\\nto show my hand sooner than I intended. As long as I might be thought\\nto be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will\\nbe doubly careful. Yes--doubly careful.\" He turned to me abruptly. \"Tell\\nme, Hastings, you yourself--have you no suspicions of anybody?\"\\n\\nI hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in itself,\\nhad once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had rejected\\nit as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.\\n\\n\"You couldn\\'t call it a suspicion,\" I murmured. \"It\\'s so utterly\\nfoolish.\"\\n\\n\"Come now,\" urged Poirot encouragingly. \"Do not fear. Speak your mind.\\nYou should always pay attention to your instincts.\"\\n\\n\"Well then,\" I blurted out, \"it\\'s absurd--but I suspect Miss Howard of\\nnot telling all she knows!\"\\n\\n\"Miss Howard?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--you\\'ll laugh at me----\"\\n\\n\"Not at all. Why should I?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t help feeling,\" I continued blunderingly; \"that we\\'ve rather\\nleft her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her\\nhaving been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen\\nmiles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively\\nthat she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my friend,\" said Poirot unexpectedly, \"we can. One of my first\\nactions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday,\\nand that--a convoy coming in unexpectedly--she had kindly offered to\\nremain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That disposes\\nof that.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" I said, rather nonplussed. \"Really,\" I continued, \"it\\'s her\\nextraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off\\nsuspecting her. I can\\'t help feeling she\\'d do anything against him. And\\nI had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the will.\\nShe might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier one in\\nhis favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.\"\\n\\n\"You consider her vehemence unnatural?\"\\n\\n\"Y--es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite\\nsane on that point.\"\\n\\nPoirot shook his head energetically.\\n\\n\"No, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded\\nor degenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of\\nwell-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.\"\\n\\n\"Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was--a very\\nridiculous one, no doubt--that she had intended to poison him--and that,\\nin some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I don\\'t\\nat all see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and\\nridiculous to the last degree.\"\\n\\n\"Still you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect\\neverybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\\nthat they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss\\nHoward\\'s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?\"\\n\\n\"Why, she was devoted to her!\" I exclaimed.\\n\\n\"Tcha! Tcha!\" cried Poirot irritably. \"You argue like a child. If\\nMiss Howard were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\\nequally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere.\\nYou are perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\\nAlfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\\nin the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions, which\\nI believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at present.\" He\\npaused a minute, then went on. \"Now, to my way of thinking, there is one\\ninsuperable objection to Miss Howard\\'s being the murderess.\"\\n\\n\"And that is?\"\\n\\n\"That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s death benefit Miss\\nHoward. Now there is no murder without a motive.\"\\n\\nI reflected.\\n\\n\"Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?\" Poirot shook\\nhis head.\\n\\n\"But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?\"\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\n\"That was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the person\\nwho was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the same\\nposition, so I used her name instead.\"\\n\\n\"Still, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the\\nafternoon of her death may----\"\\n\\nBut Poirot\\'s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.\\n\\n\"No, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\\nBut I can tell you this much--it was not in Miss Howard\\'s favour.\"\\n\\nI accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be so\\npositive about the matter.\\n\\n\"Well,\" I said, with a sigh, \"we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is\\npartly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said\\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.\"\\n\\nPoirot looked puzzled.\\n\\n\"What did I say about her evidence at the inquest?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above\\nsuspicion?\"\\n\\n\"Oh--ah--yes.\" He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. \"By\\nthe way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. What is it?\"\\n\\n\"Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you to\\nsay this to him. \\'I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says: \"Find\\nthe extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!\"\\' Nothing more. Nothing\\nless.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\\' Is that right?\"\\nI asked, much mystified.\\n\\n\"Excellent.\"\\n\\n\"But what does it mean?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.\\nJust say that to him, and see what he says.\"\\n\\n\"Very well--but it\\'s all extremely mysterious.\"\\n\\nWe were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the\\n\"Analytical Chemist.\"\\n\\nPoirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was\\nback again.\\n\\n\"There,\" he said. \"That is all my business.\"\\n\\n\"What were you doing there?\" I asked, in lively curiosity.\\n\\n\"I left something to be analysed.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but what?\"\\n\\n\"The sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.\"\\n\\n\"But that has already been tested!\" I cried, stupefied. \"Dr. Bauerstein\\nhad it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\\nbeing strychnine in it.\"\\n\\n\"I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,\" replied Poirot quietly.\\n\\n\"Well, then?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.\"\\n\\nAnd not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.\\n\\nThis proceeding of Poirot\\'s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\\nintensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my\\nconfidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\\nrestored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp\\'s innocence had been so\\ntriumphantly vindicated.\\n\\nThe funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on\\nMonday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and\\ninformed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up his\\nquarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his plans.\\n\\n\"And really it\\'s a great relief to think he\\'s going, Hastings,\"\\ncontinued my honest friend. \"It was bad enough before, when we thought\\nhe\\'d done it, but I\\'m hanged if it isn\\'t worse now, when we all feel\\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, we\\'ve treated\\nhim abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I don\\'t\\nsee how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did.\\nStill, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there\\'s a beastly\\nfeeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when one\\ndoesn\\'t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole\\nthing\\'s damned awkward! And I\\'m thankful he\\'s had the tact to take\\nhimself off. It\\'s a good thing Styles wasn\\'t the mater\\'s to leave to\\nhim. Couldn\\'t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He\\'s welcome\\nto her money.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be able to keep up the place all right?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father\\'s\\nmoney goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the\\npresent, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first, of\\ncourse, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole financially\\nmyself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now.\"\\n\\nIn the general relief at Inglethorp\\'s approaching departure, we had the\\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia,\\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her pretty\\nself again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who seemed\\nunalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the opening of\\na new and hopeful future.\\n\\nThe papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines,\\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\\ninnuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\\nNothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily\\ninactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\\nfashionable life: \"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\" was the topic of the\\nmoment.\\n\\nNaturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was\\nconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\\nadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds, where\\nthey lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the household.\\nWe all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men came and\\nwent, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of tongue. Towards\\nwhat end they were working, we did not know. Had they any clue, or would\\nthe whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes?\\n\\nAfter breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if\\nshe might have a few words with me.\\n\\n\"Certainly. What is it, Dorcas?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s just this, sir. You\\'ll be seeing the Belgian gentleman\\nto-day perhaps?\" I nodded. \"Well, sir, you know how he asked me so\\nparticular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes. You have found one?\" My interest was aroused.\\n\\n\"No, not that, sir. But since then I\\'ve remembered what the young\\ngentlemen\"--John and Lawrence were still the \"young gentlemen\" to\\nDorcas--\"call the \\'dressing-up box.\\' It\\'s up in the front attic, sir. A\\ngreat chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And it\\ncame to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them.\\nSo, if you\\'d tell the Belgian gentleman----\"\\n\\n\"I will tell him, Dorcas,\" I promised.\\n\\n\"Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite\\na different class from them two detectives from London, what goes prying\\nabout, and asking questions. I don\\'t hold with foreigners as a rule, but\\nfrom what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave Belges isn\\'t\\nthe ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he\\'s a most polite spoken\\ngentleman.\"\\n\\nDear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned\\nto mine, I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned\\nservant that is so fast dying out.\\n\\nI thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up\\nPoirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once gave\\nhim Dorcas\\'s message.\\n\\n\"Ah, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although--but no\\nmatter--we will examine it all the same.\"\\n\\nWe entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the\\nhall, and we went straight up to the attic.\\n\\nSure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with\\nbrass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\\ngarment.\\n\\nPoirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There\\nwere one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his\\nhead over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as\\nthough he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an\\nexclamation.\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"Look!\"\\n\\nThe chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom, was\\na magnificent black beard.\\n\\n\"_Ohó!_\" said Poirot. \"_Ohó!_\" He turned it over in his hands, examining\\nit closely. \"New,\" he remarked. \"Yes, quite new.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all\\nthe other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly\\ndownstairs. He went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas busily\\npolishing her silver.\\n\\nPoirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on:\\n\\n\"We have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to\\nyou for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are\\nthey often used, may I ask?\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do have\\nwhat the young gentlemen call \\'a dress-up night.\\' And very funny it is\\nsometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he\\'s wonderful. Most comic! I shall never\\nforget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he called\\nit--a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in his\\nhand, and \\'Mind, Dorcas,\\' he says, \\'you\\'ll have to be very respectful.\\nThis is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it\\'s off with your head if\\nI\\'m at all displeased with you!\\' Miss Cynthia, she was what they call an\\nApache, or some such name--a Frenchified sort of cut-throat, I take it\\nto be. A real sight she looked. You\\'d never have believed a pretty young\\nlady like that could have made herself into such a ruffian. Nobody would\\nhave known her.\"\\n\\n\"These evenings must have been great fun,\" said Poirot genially. \"I\\nsuppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,\\nwhen he was Shah of Persia?\"\\n\\n\"He did have a beard, sir,\" replied Dorcas, smiling. \"And well I know\\nit, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And I\\'m\\nsure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn\\'t know as\\nthere was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately, I\\nthink. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of hair.\\nBurnt corks they use mostly--though \\'tis messy getting it off again.\\nMiss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.\"\\n\\n\"So Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,\" said Poirot\\nthoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.\\n\\n\"Do you think it is _the_ one?\" I whispered eagerly.\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\"I do. You notice it had been trimmed?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp\\'s, and I found one\\nor two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.\"\\n\\n\"Who put it in the chest, I wonder?\"\\n\\n\"Someone with a good deal of intelligence,\" remarked Poirot dryly. \"You\\nrealize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\\npresence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be\\nmore intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\\nof being intelligent at all.\"\\n\\nI acquiesced.\\n\\n\"There, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.\"\\n\\nI was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly\\nthought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, \"you will be\\ninvaluable.\"\\n\\nThis was naturally gratifying, but Poirot\\'s next words were not so\\nwelcome.\\n\\n\"I must have an ally in the house,\" he observed reflectively.\\n\\n\"You have me,\" I protested.\\n\\n\"True, but you are not sufficient.\"\\n\\nI was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.\\n\\n\"You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.\\nI want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see. How about John?\"\\n\\n\"No, I think not.\"\\n\\n\"The dear fellow isn\\'t perhaps very bright,\" I said thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"Here comes Miss Howard,\" said Poirot suddenly. \"She is the very person.\\nBut I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp. Still, we\\ncan but try.\"\\n\\nWith a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot\\'s\\nrequest for a few minutes\\' conversation.\\n\\nWe went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.\\n\\n\"Well, Monsieur Poirot,\" said Miss Howard impatiently, \"what is it? Out\\nwith it. I\\'m busy.\"\\n\\n\"Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do.\" The lady nodded. \"And I told you I\\'d help you with\\npleasure--to hang Alfred Inglethorp.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" Poirot studied her seriously. \"Miss Howard, I will ask you one\\nquestion. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.\"\\n\\n\"Never tell lies,\" replied Miss Howard.\\n\\n\"It is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by\\nher husband?\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked sharply. \"You needn\\'t think your pretty\\nexplanations influence me in the slightest. I\\'ll admit that it wasn\\'t he\\nwho bought strychnine at the chemist\\'s shop. What of that? I dare say he\\nsoaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.\"\\n\\n\"That is arsenic--not strychnine,\" said Poirot mildly.\\n\\n\"What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way just\\nas well as strychnine. If I\\'m convinced he did it, it doesn\\'t matter a\\njot to me _how_ he did it.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it,\" said Poirot quietly. \"I\\nwill put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of\\nhearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Miss Howard. \"Haven\\'t I always told you the man\\nis a villain? Haven\\'t I always told you he would murder her in her bed?\\nHaven\\'t I always hated him like poison?\"\\n\\n\"Exactly,\" said Poirot. \"That bears out my little idea entirely.\"\\n\\n\"What little idea?\"\\n\\n\"Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the\\nday of my friend\\'s arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is\\na sentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember\\naffirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\\nbeen murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\\ncriminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it\\nnonsense?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\\n\"And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred\\nInglethorp.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Poirot curtly. \"Because your instinct is not against Mr.\\nInglethorp.\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"No. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him capable\\nof committing it. But your instinct tells you he did not commit it. It\\ntells you more--shall I go on?\"\\n\\nShe was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative\\nmovement of the hand.\\n\\n\"Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp?\\nIt is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\\nIt is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\\ntells you another name----\"\\n\\n\"No, no, no!\" cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. \"Don\\'t\\nsay it! Oh, don\\'t say it! It isn\\'t true! It can\\'t be true. I don\\'t know\\nwhat put such a wild--such a dreadful--idea into my head!\"\\n\\n\"I am right, am I not?\" asked Poirot.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can\\'t be\\nso--it\\'s too monstrous, too impossible. It must be Alfred Inglethorp.\"\\n\\nPoirot shook his head gravely.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t ask me about it,\" continued Miss Howard, \"because I shan\\'t tell\\nyou. I won\\'t admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a\\nthing.\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded, as if satisfied.\\n\\n\"I will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.\\nAnd I--I, too, have an instinct. We are working together towards a\\ncommon end.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t ask me to help you, because I won\\'t. I wouldn\\'t lift a finger\\nto--to----\" She faltered.\\n\\n\"You will help me in spite of yourself. I ask you nothing--but you will\\nbe my ally. You will not be able to help yourself. You will do the only\\nthing that I want of you.\"\\n\\n\"And that is?\"\\n\\n\"You will watch!\"\\n\\nEvelyn Howard bowed her head.\\n\\n\"Yes, I can\\'t help doing that. I am always watching--always hoping I\\nshall be proved wrong.\"\\n\\n\"If we are wrong, well and good,\" said Poirot. \"No one will be more\\npleased than I shall. But, if we are right? If we are right, Miss\\nHoward, on whose side are you then?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know----\"\\n\\n\"Come now.\"\\n\\n\"It could be hushed up.\"\\n\\n\"There must be no hushing up.\"\\n\\n\"But Emily herself----\" She broke off.\\n\\n\"Miss Howard,\" said Poirot gravely, \"this is unworthy of you.\"\\n\\nSuddenly she took her face from her hands.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said quietly, \"that was not Evelyn Howard who spoke!\" She\\nflung her head up proudly. \"_This_ is Evelyn Howard! And she is on the\\nside of Justice! Let the cost be what it may.\" And with these words, she\\nwalked firmly out of the room.\\n\\n\"There,\" said Poirot, looking after her, \"goes a very valuable ally.\\nThat woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.\"\\n\\nI did not reply.\\n\\n\"Instinct is a marvellous thing,\" mused Poirot. \"It can neither be\\nexplained nor ignored.\"\\n\\n\"You and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about,\" I\\nobserved coldly. \"Perhaps you don\\'t realize that I am still in the\\ndark.\"\\n\\n\"Really? Is that so, _mon ami?_\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Enlighten me, will you?\"\\n\\nPoirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. Then, to my intense\\nsurprise, he shook his head decidedly.\\n\\n\"No, my friend.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, look here, why not?\"\\n\\n\"Two is enough for a secret.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.\"\\n\\n\"I am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your\\npossession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is\\na question of ideas.\"\\n\\n\"Still, it would be interesting to know.\"\\n\\nPoirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.\\n\\n\"You see,\" he said sadly, \"_you_ have no instincts.\"\\n\\n\"It was intelligence you were requiring just now,\" I pointed out.\\n\\n\"The two often go together,\" said Poirot enigmatically.\\n\\nThe remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the\\ntrouble to answer it. But I decided that if I made any interesting\\nand important discoveries--as no doubt I should--I would keep them to\\nmyself, and surprise Poirot with the ultimate result.\\n\\nThere are times when it is one\\'s duty to assert oneself.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. DR. BAUERSTEIN\\n\\nI HAD had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot\\'s message to\\nLawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a grudge\\nagainst my friend\\'s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the croquet lawn,\\naimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about, with a still\\nmore ancient mallet.\\n\\nIt struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.\\nOtherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I did\\nnot quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by Lawrence\\'s\\nreply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my part, I\\nshould soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted him.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been looking for you,\" I remarked untruthfully.\\n\\n\"Have you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. The truth is, I\\'ve got a message for you--from Poirot.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\n\"He told me to wait until I was alone with you,\" I said, dropping my\\nvoice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of\\nmy eye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe,\\ncreating an atmosphere.\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\nThere was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he\\nany idea of what I was about to say?\\n\\n\"This is the message.\" I dropped my voice still lower. \"\\'Find the extra\\ncoffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\\'\"\\n\\n\"What on earth does he mean?\" Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected\\nastonishment.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you know?\"\\n\\n\"Not in the least. Do you?\"\\n\\nI was compelled to shake my head.\\n\\n\"What extra coffee-cup?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'d better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about\\ncoffee-cups. It\\'s their business, not mine. I don\\'t know anything about\\nthe coffee-cups, except that we\\'ve got some that are never used, which\\nare a perfect dream! Old Worcester. You\\'re not a connoisseur, are you,\\nHastings?\"\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n\"You miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china--it\\'s pure delight to\\nhandle it, or even to look at it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what am I to tell Poirot?\"\\n\\n\"Tell him I don\\'t know what he\\'s talking about. It\\'s double Dutch to\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"All right.\"\\n\\nI was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me\\nback.\\n\\n\"I say, what was the end of that message? Say it over again, will you?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\\' Are you sure\\nyou don\\'t know what it means?\" I asked him earnestly.\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\n\"No,\" he said musingly, \"I don\\'t. I--I wish I did.\"\\n\\nThe boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.\\nPoirot had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already seated\\nat the table.\\n\\nBy tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. We conversed on\\nthe war, and other outside topics. But after the cheese and biscuits had\\nbeen handed round, and Dorcas had left the room, Poirot suddenly leant\\nforward to Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\n\"Pardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have\\na little idea\"--Poirot\\'s \"little ideas\" were becoming a perfect\\nbyword--\"and would like to ask one or two questions.\"\\n\\n\"Of me? Certainly.\"\\n\\n\"You are too amiable, madame. What I want to ask is this: the door\\nleading into Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia,\\nit was bolted, you say?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly it was bolted,\" replied Mary Cavendish, rather surprised. \"I\\nsaid so at the inquest.\"\\n\\n\"Bolted?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\" She looked perplexed.\\n\\n\"I mean,\" explained Poirot, \"you are sure it was bolted, and not merely\\nlocked?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see what you mean. No, I don\\'t know. I said bolted, meaning that\\nit was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors\\nwere found bolted on the inside.\"\\n\\n\"Still, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have\\nbeen locked?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\n\\n\"You yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs.\\nInglethorp\\'s room, whether that door was bolted or not?\"\\n\\n\"I--I believe it was.\"\\n\\n\"But you did not see it?\"\\n\\n\"No. I--never looked.\"\\n\\n\"But I did,\" interrupted Lawrence suddenly. \"I happened to notice that\\nit _was_ bolted.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that settles it.\" And Poirot looked crestfallen.\\n\\nI could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his \"little ideas\" had\\ncome to naught.\\n\\nAfter lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather\\nstiffly.\\n\\n\"You are annoyed, is it not so?\" he asked anxiously, as we walked\\nthrough the park.\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" I said coldly.\\n\\n\"That is well. That lifts a great load from my mind.\"\\n\\nThis was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he would have\\nobserved the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words\\nwent towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed.\\n\\n\"I gave Lawrence your message,\" I said.\\n\\n\"And what did he say? He was entirely puzzled?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.\"\\n\\nI had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he\\nreplied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. My\\npride forbade me to ask any questions.\\n\\nPoirot switched off on another tack.\\n\\n\"Mademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?\"\\n\\n\"She is at the hospital again. She resumed work to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, she is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She is\\nlike pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that\\ndispensary of hers. Do you think she would show it to me?\"\\n\\n\"I am sure she would be delighted. It\\'s an interesting little place.\"\\n\\n\"Does she go there every day?\"\\n\\n\"She has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays. Those\\nare her only times off.\"\\n\\n\"I will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle\\nCynthia is clever--oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.\"\\n\\n\"Without doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they\\nhave very strong poisons there?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little\\ncupboard. I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out\\nthe key before leaving the room.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?\"\\n\\n\"No, right the other side of the room. Why?\"\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\"I wondered. That is all. Will you come in?\"\\n\\nWe had reached the cottage.\\n\\n\"No. I think I\\'ll be getting back. I shall go round the long way through\\nthe woods.\"\\n\\nThe woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the\\nopen park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.\\nThere was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was faint\\nand subdued. I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself down\\nat the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were\\nkindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In\\nfact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned.\\n\\nI thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and far\\noff.\\n\\nI yawned again.\\n\\nProbably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all\\na bad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had\\nmurdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of\\nJohn to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: \"I tell you I\\nwon\\'t have it!\"\\n\\nI woke up with a start.\\n\\nAt once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about\\ntwelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing\\nfacing each other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as\\nevidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or\\nspeak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.\\n\\n\"I tell you, Mary, I won\\'t have it.\"\\n\\nMary\\'s voice came, cool and liquid:\\n\\n\"Have _you_ any right to criticize my actions?\"\\n\\n\"It will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on\\nSaturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" she shrugged her shoulders, \"if it is only village gossip that you\\nmind!\"\\n\\n\"But it isn\\'t. I\\'ve had enough of the fellow hanging about. He\\'s a\\nPolish Jew, anyway.\"\\n\\n\"A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens the\"--she looked\\nat him--\"stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman.\"\\n\\nFire in her eyes, ice in her voice. I did not wonder that the blood rose\\nto John\\'s face in a crimson tide.\\n\\n\"Mary!\"\\n\\n\"Well?\" Her tone did not change.\\n\\nThe pleading died out of his voice.\\n\\n\"Am I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my\\nexpress wishes?\"\\n\\n\"If I choose.\"\\n\\n\"You defy me?\"\\n\\n\"No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have _you_ no\\nfriends of whom I should disapprove?\"\\n\\nJohn fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face.\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" he said, in an unsteady voice.\\n\\n\"You see!\" said Mary quietly. \"You _do_ see, don\\'t you, that _you_ have\\nno right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?\"\\n\\nJohn glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.\\n\\n\"No right? Have I _no_ right, Mary?\" he said unsteadily. He stretched\\nout his hands. \"Mary----\"\\n\\nFor a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her\\nface, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.\\n\\n\"None!\"\\n\\nShe was walking away when John sprang after her, and caught her by the\\narm.\\n\\n\"Mary\"--his voice was very quiet now--\"are you in love with this fellow\\nBauerstein?\"\\n\\nShe hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange\\nexpression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about\\nit. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled.\\n\\nShe freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,\\nleaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone.\\n\\nRather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches\\nwith my feet as I did so. John turned. Luckily, he took it for granted\\nthat I had only just come upon the scene.\\n\\n\"Hullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his\\ncottage? Quaint little chap! Is he any good, though, really?\"\\n\\n\"He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten\\nworld it is, though!\"\\n\\n\"You find it so?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Good Lord, yes! There\\'s this terrible business to start with. Scotland\\nYard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know\\nwhere they won\\'t turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in\\nthe country--damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a\\nwhole crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame\\nTussaud\\'s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.\\nPretty thick, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Cheer up, John!\" I said soothingly. \"It can\\'t last for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to\\nhold up our heads again.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, you\\'re getting morbid on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and\\nstared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! But there\\'s\\nworse than that.\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\nJohn lowered his voice:\\n\\n\"Have you ever thought, Hastings--it\\'s a nightmare to me--who did it?\\nI can\\'t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.\\nBecause--because--who could have done it? Now Inglethorp\\'s out of the\\nway, there\\'s no one else; no one, I mean, except--one of us.\"\\n\\nYes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes,\\nsurely it must be so, unless-----\\n\\nA new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it. The\\nlight increased. Poirot\\'s mysterious doings, his hints--they all fitted\\nin. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and\\nwhat a relief for us all.\\n\\n\"No, John,\" I said, \"it isn\\'t one of us. How could it be?\"\\n\\n\"I know, but, still, who else is there?\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you guess?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\nI looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.\\n\\n\"Dr. Bauerstein!\" I whispered.\\n\\n\"Impossible!\"\\n\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\\n\"But what earthly interest could he have in my mother\\'s death?\"\\n\\n\"That I don\\'t see,\" I confessed, \"but I\\'ll tell you this: Poirot thinks\\nso.\"\\n\\n\"Poirot? Does he? How do you know?\"\\n\\nI told him of Poirot\\'s intense excitement on hearing that Dr. Bauerstein\\nhad been at Styles on the fatal night, and added:\\n\\n\"He said twice: \\'That alters everything.\\' And I\\'ve been thinking. You\\nknow Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? Well,\\nit was just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn\\'t it possible that, as\\nInglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\\ninto the coffee in passing?\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m,\" said John. \"It would have been very risky.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but it was possible.\"\\n\\n\"And then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I don\\'t\\nthink that will wash.\"\\n\\nBut I had remembered something else.\\n\\n\"You\\'re quite right. That wasn\\'t how it was done. Listen.\" And I then\\ntold him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.\\n\\nJohn interrupted just as I had done.\\n\\n\"But, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, that\\'s the point. I didn\\'t see it either until now. Don\\'t you\\nunderstand? Bauerstein had it analysed--that\\'s just it! If Bauerstein\\'s\\nthe murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to substitute some\\nordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be tested. And of course\\nthey would find no strychnine! But no one would dream of suspecting\\nBauerstein, or think of taking another sample--except Poirot,\" I added,\\nwith belated recognition.\\n\\n\"Yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won\\'t disguise?\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ve only his word for that. And there are other possibilities.\\nHe\\'s admittedly one of the world\\'s greatest toxicologists----\"\\n\\n\"One of the world\\'s greatest what? Say it again.\"\\n\\n\"He knows more about poisons than almost anybody,\" I explained. \"Well,\\nmy idea is, that perhaps he\\'s found some way of making strychnine\\ntasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\\ndrug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m, yes, that might be,\" said John. \"But look here, how could he have\\ngot at the cocoa? That wasn\\'t downstairs?\"\\n\\n\"No, it wasn\\'t,\" I admitted reluctantly.\\n\\nAnd then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I\\nhoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at\\nhim. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief,\\nfor the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\\nDr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\\n\\nYet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary\\nCavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to\\npoison.\\n\\nAnd suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\\nmy arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\\nwoman\\'s weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday evening!\\nHad Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and Bauerstein, and\\nthreatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that denunciation that\\nthe crime had been committed?\\n\\nThen I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and\\nEvelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous\\npossibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?\\n\\nYes, it all fitted in.\\n\\nNo wonder Miss Howard had suggested \"hushing it up.\" Now I understood\\nthat unfinished sentence of hers: \"Emily herself----\" And in my heart\\nI agreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go\\nunavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name of\\nCavendish.\\n\\n\"There\\'s another thing,\" said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound\\nof his voice made me start guiltily. \"Something which makes me doubt if\\nwhat you say can be true.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\\nof how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\\n\\n\"Why, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn\\'t have\\ndone so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\\nheart disease.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I said doubtfully. \"But we don\\'t know. Perhaps he thought it\\nsafer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the\\nHome Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have\\ncome out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\\none would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\\ndeceived into calling it heart disease.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s possible,\" admitted John. \"Still,\" he added, \"I\\'m blest if\\nI can see what his motive could have been.\"\\n\\nI trembled.\\n\\n\"Look here,\" I said, \"I may be altogether wrong. And, remember, all this\\nis in confidence.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, of course--that goes without saying.\"\\n\\nWe had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\\ninto the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\\nthe sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\\n\\nCynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her,\\nand told her of Poirot\\'s wish to visit the dispensary.\\n\\n\"Of course! I\\'d love him to see it. He\\'d better come to tea there one\\nday. I must fix it up with him. He\\'s such a dear little man! But he _is_\\nfunny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and put\\nit in again, because he said it wasn\\'t straight.\"\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite a mania with him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\nWe were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\\nof Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said:\\n\\n\"Mr. Hastings.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\n\"After tea, I want to talk to you.\"\\n\\nHer glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these two\\nthere existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred\\nto me to wonder about the girl\\'s future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no\\nprovisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would\\nprobably insist on her making her home with them--at any rate until the\\nend of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\\nto let her go.\\n\\nJohn, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured face\\nwore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\\n\\n\"Confound those detectives! I can\\'t think what they\\'re after! They\\'ve\\nbeen in every room in the house--turning things inside out, and upside\\ndown. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all\\nbeing out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!\"\\n\\n\"Lot of Paul Prys,\" grunted Miss Howard.\\n\\nLawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\\n\\nMary Cavendish said nothing.\\n\\nAfter tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\\ninto the woods together.\\n\\n\"Well?\" I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by the\\nleafy screen.\\n\\nWith a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The\\nsunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\\nto quivering gold.\\n\\n\"Mr. Hastings--you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.\"\\n\\nIt struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming\\ngirl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.\\n\\n\"Well?\" I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\\n\\n\"I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?\"\\n\\n\"Do?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I\\nsuppose she forgot, or didn\\'t think she was likely to die--anyway, I am\\n_not_ provided for! And I don\\'t know what to do. Do you think I ought to\\ngo away from here at once?\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens, no! They don\\'t want to part with you, I\\'m sure.\"\\n\\nCynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\\nThen she said: \"Mrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.\"\\n\\n\"Hates you?\" I cried, astonished.\\n\\nCynthia nodded.\\n\\n\"Yes. I don\\'t know why, but she can\\'t bear me; and _he_ can\\'t, either.\"\\n\\n\"There I know you\\'re wrong,\" I said warmly. \"On the contrary, John is\\nvery fond of you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes--_John_. I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether\\nLawrence hates me or not. Still, it\\'s rather horrid when no one loves\\nyou, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"But they do, Cynthia dear,\" I said earnestly. \"I\\'m sure you are\\nmistaken. Look, there is John--and Miss Howard--\"\\n\\nCynthia nodded rather gloomily. \"Yes, John likes me, I think, and of\\ncourse Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn\\'t be unkind to a fly. But\\nLawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and Mary can hardly bring\\nherself to be civil to me. She wants Evie to stay on, is begging her to,\\nbut she doesn\\'t want me, and--and--I don\\'t know what to do.\" Suddenly\\nthe poor child burst out crying.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what possessed me. Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\\nwith the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of relief\\nat encountering someone who so obviously could have no connection with\\nthe tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and loneliness. Anyway, I\\nleant forward, and taking her little hand, I said awkwardly:\\n\\n\"Marry me, Cynthia.\"\\n\\nUnwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat up\\nat once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be silly!\"\\n\\nI was a little annoyed.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming my\\nwife.\"\\n\\nTo my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\\n\"funny dear.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s perfectly sweet of you,\" she said, \"but you know you don\\'t want\\nto!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do. I\\'ve got--\"\\n\\n\"Never mind what you\\'ve got. You don\\'t really want to--and I don\\'t\\neither.\"\\n\\n\"Well, of course, that settles it,\" I said stiffly. \"But I don\\'t see\\nanything to laugh at. There\\'s nothing funny about a proposal.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" said Cynthia. \"Somebody might accept you next time.\\nGood-bye, you\\'ve cheered me up very much.\"\\n\\nAnd, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\\nthrough the trees.\\n\\nThinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\\nunsatisfactory.\\n\\nIt occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and look\\nup Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow. At the\\nsame time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might have as to\\nhis being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on my diplomacy.\\nAccordingly, I went to the little house with the \"Apartments\" card\\ninserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and tapped on the door.\\n\\nAn old woman came and opened it.\\n\\n\"Good afternoon,\" I said pleasantly. \"Is Dr. Bauerstein in?\"\\n\\nShe stared at me.\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t you heard?\"\\n\\n\"Heard what?\"\\n\\n\"About him.\"\\n\\n\"What about him?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s took.\"\\n\\n\"Took? Dead?\"\\n\\n\"No, took by the perlice.\"\\n\\n\"By the police!\" I gasped. \"Do you mean they\\'ve arrested him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s it, and--\"\\n\\nI waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. THE ARREST\\n\\nTo my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who\\nanswered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.\\n\\nI was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was it\\na sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind when\\nhe parted from me a few hours earlier?\\n\\nI retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I was\\nuncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in all\\nprobability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not resolve.\\nBut in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the arrest\\nopenly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to myself, the\\nthought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not be a terrible\\nshock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any suspicions of her.\\nShe could not be implicated--otherwise I should have heard some hint of\\nit.\\n\\nOf course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\\nconceal Dr. Bauerstein\\'s arrest from her. It would be announced in every\\nnewspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If\\nonly Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What\\npossessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?\\n\\nIn spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\\nheightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\\nPoirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\\n\\nAfter some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and\\nleave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\\n\\nHe gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.\\n\\n\"Great Scot! You _were_ right, then. I couldn\\'t believe it at the time.\"\\n\\n\"No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\\nmakes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be\\ngenerally known to-morrow.\"\\n\\nJohn reflected.\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" he said at last, \"we won\\'t say anything at present. There\\nis no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.\"\\n\\nBut to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\\neagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\\nThere was a column of mere padding about \"The Styles Poisoning Case,\"\\nbut nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that,\\nfor some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It\\nworried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\\nmight be further arrests to come.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot\\nhad returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked\\none of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\\n\\n\"_Bonjour, mon ami!_\"\\n\\n\"Poirot,\" I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I\\ndragged him into the room. \"I was never so glad to see anyone. Listen, I\\nhave said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?\"\\n\\n\"My friend,\" replied Poirot, \"I do not know what you are talking about.\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Bauerstein\\'s arrest, of course,\" I answered impatiently.\\n\\n\"Is Bauerstein arrested, then?\"\\n\\n\"Did you not know it?\"\\n\\n\"Not the least in the world.\" But, pausing a moment, he added: \"Still,\\nit does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the\\ncoast.\"\\n\\n\"The coast?\" I asked, puzzled. \"What has that got to do with it?\"\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\"Surely, it is obvious!\"\\n\\n\"Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the\\nproximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.\\nInglethorp.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing at all, of course,\" replied Poirot, smiling. \"But we were\\nspeaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp----\"\\n\\n\"What?\" cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. \"Dr. Bauerstein\\narrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my\\nfriend?\"\\n\\n\"Well, no one exactly told me,\" I confessed. \"But he is arrested.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, _mon ami_.\"\\n\\n\"Espionage?\" I gasped.\\n\\n\"Precisely.\"\\n\\n\"Not for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?\"\\n\\n\"Not unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,\" replied\\nPoirot placidly.\\n\\n\"But--but I thought you thought so too?\"\\n\\nPoirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\\nsense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.\\n\\n\"Do you mean to say,\" I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\\n\"that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\"Have you never suspected it?\"\\n\\n\"It never entered my head.\"\\n\\n\"It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should\\nbury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit\\nof walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I confessed, \"I never thought of such a thing.\"\\n\\n\"He is, of course, a German by birth,\" said Poirot thoughtfully, \"though\\nhe has practiced so long in this country that nobody thinks of him as\\nanything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen years ago.\\nA very clever man--a Jew, of course.\"\\n\\n\"The blackguard!\" I cried indignantly.\\n\\n\"Not at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he stands to\\nlose. I admire the man myself.\"\\n\\nBut I could not look at it in Poirot\\'s philosophical way.\\n\\n\"And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about\\nall over the country!\" I cried indignantly.\\n\\n\"Yes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,\" remarked Poirot. \"So\\nlong as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any other\\nvagaries of the doctor\\'s passed unobserved.\"\\n\\n\"Then you think he never really cared for her?\" I asked eagerly--rather\\ntoo eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\\n\\n\"That, of course, I cannot say, but--shall I tell you my own private\\nopinion, Hastings?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has\\ncared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!\"\\n\\n\"Do you really think so?\" I could not disguise my pleasure.\\n\\n\"I am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\n\"Because she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread\\nover me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I remembered\\ncertain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time, perhaps, but\\nwhich certainly seemed to indicate----\\n\\nMy pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss\\nHoward. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else\\nin the room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she\\nhanded to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\\n\\n\"On top of the wardrobe.\" Then she hurriedly left the room.\\n\\nPoirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\\nof satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.\\n\\n\"Come here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial--J. or L.?\"\\n\\nIt was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\\nlain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting Poirot\\'s\\nattention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs. Parkson\\'s,\\nthe well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed to \"--(the\\ndebatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St. Mary,\\nEssex.\"\\n\\n\"It might be T., or it might be L.,\" I said, after studying the thing\\nfor a minute or two. \"It certainly isn\\'t a J.\"\\n\\n\"Good,\" replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. \"I, also, am of your\\nway of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!\"\\n\\n\"Where did it come from?\" I asked curiously. \"Is it important?\"\\n\\n\"Moderately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its\\nexistence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\\nbeen successful.\"\\n\\n\"What did she mean by \\'On the top of the wardrobe\\'?\"\\n\\n\"She meant,\" replied Poirot promptly, \"that she found it on top of a\\nwardrobe.\"\\n\\n\"A funny place for a piece of brown paper,\" I mused.\\n\\n\"Not at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown paper\\nand cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself. Neatly arranged,\\nthere is nothing to offend the eye.\"\\n\\n\"Poirot,\" I asked earnestly, \"have you made up your mind about this\\ncrime?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\"\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless----\" With\\nsudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the\\nhall, calling out in French in his excitement: \"Mademoiselle Dorcas,\\nMademoiselle Dorcas, _un moment, s\\'il vous plaît!_\"\\n\\nDorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\\n\\n\"My good Dorcas, I have an idea--a little idea--if it should prove\\njustified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday,\\nDorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong\\nwith Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s bell?\"\\n\\nDorcas looked very surprised.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don\\'t know how you\\ncame to hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire\\nthrough. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.\"\\n\\nWith a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way back to the\\nmorning-room.\\n\\n\"See you, one should not ask for outside proof--no, reason should be\\nenough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on\\nthe right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I\\nleap!\"\\n\\nAnd, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the\\nstretch of lawn outside the long window.\\n\\n\"What is your remarkable little friend doing?\" asked a voice behind me,\\nand I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, and so did\\nI. \"What is it all about?\"\\n\\n\"Really, I can\\'t tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell,\\nand appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\\nyou see!\"\\n\\nMary laughed.\\n\\n\"How ridiculous! He\\'s going out of the gate. Isn\\'t he coming back\\nto-day?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve given up trying to guess what he\\'ll do next.\"\\n\\n\"Is he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?\"\\n\\n\"I honestly don\\'t know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a hatter;\\nand then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method in his\\nmadness.\"\\n\\n\"I see.\"\\n\\nIn spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She\\nseemed grave, almost sad.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\\nthe subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, I thought, but I had\\nnot gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.\\n\\n\"You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in\\nthis case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk\\nof encountering any unkindness from me.\"\\n\\nI began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn\\'t thought--But again\\nshe stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\\nCynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.\\n\\n\"Mr. Hastings,\" she said, \"do you think I and my husband are happy\\ntogether?\"\\n\\nI was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it\\'s not\\nbeing my business to think anything of the sort.\\n\\n\"Well,\" she said quietly, \"whether it is your business or not, I will\\ntell you that we are _not_ happy.\"\\n\\nI said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.\\n\\nShe began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,\\nand that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. She\\nstopped suddenly, and looked up at me.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know anything about me, do you?\" she asked. \"Where I come\\nfrom, who I was before I married John--anything, in fact? Well, I\\nwill tell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I\\nthink--yes, I am sure you are kind.\"\\n\\nSomehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered\\nthat Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way. Besides,\\na father confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a\\nyoung man.\\n\\n\"My father was English,\" said Mrs. Cavendish, \"but my mother was a\\nRussian.\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" I said, \"now I understand--\"\\n\\n\"Understand what?\"\\n\\n\"A hint of something foreign--different--that there has always been\\nabout you.\"\\n\\n\"My mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don\\'t know, because I never\\nsaw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was\\nsome tragedy connected with her death--she took an overdose of some\\nsleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was\\nbroken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service.\\nEverywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had been\\nnearly all over the world. It was a splendid life--I loved it.\"\\n\\nThere was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She seemed\\nliving in the memory of those old glad days.\\n\\n\"Then my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and live\\nwith some old aunts in Yorkshire.\" She shuddered. \"You will understand\\nme when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had\\nbeen. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.\"\\nShe paused a minute, and added in a different tone: \"And then I met John\\nCavendish.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\n\"You can imagine that, from my aunts\\' point of view, it was a very good\\nmatch for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\\nwith me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\\nmonotony of my life.\"\\n\\nI said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told him, what\\nwas true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him\\nmore, but that I was not in any way what the world calls \\'in love\\' with\\nhim. He declared that that satisfied him, and so--we were married.\"\\n\\nShe waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead. She\\nseemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.\\n\\n\"I think--I am sure--he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not\\nwell matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He--it is not a pleasing\\nthing for my pride, but it is the truth--tired of me very soon.\" I must\\nhave made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: \"Oh, yes, he\\ndid! Not that it matters now--now that we\\'ve come to the parting of the\\nways.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\nShe answered quietly:\\n\\n\"I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.\"\\n\\n\"You and John are not going to live here?\"\\n\\n\"John may live here, but I shall not.\"\\n\\n\"You are going to leave him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But why?\"\\n\\nShe paused a long time, and said at last:\\n\\n\"Perhaps--because I want to be--free!\"\\n\\nAnd, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\\nof forests, untrodden lands--and a realization of what freedom would\\nmean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to see her for a\\nmoment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as\\nsome shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke from her lips:\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know, you don\\'t know, how this hateful place has been prison\\nto me!\"\\n\\n\"I understand,\" I said, \"but--but don\\'t do anything rash.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, rash!\" Her voice mocked at my prudence.\\n\\nThen suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for:\\n\\n\"You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?\"\\n\\nAn instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all\\nexpression.\\n\\n\"John was so kind as to break that to me this morning.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what do you think?\" I asked feebly.\\n\\n\"Of what?\"\\n\\n\"Of the arrest?\"\\n\\n\"What should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener had\\ntold John.\"\\n\\nHer face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she\\ncare, or did she not?\\n\\nShe moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.\\n\\n\"These are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind\\nmoving--thank you, Mr. Hastings.\" And she walked quietly past me out of\\nthe window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.\\n\\nNo, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her\\npart with that icy unconcern.\\n\\nPoirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was\\nno sign of the Scotland Yard men.\\n\\nBut, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence--or rather\\nlack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which\\nMrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our\\nefforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that\\nit might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen,\\nin the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from a\\nfirm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s cheque,\\nand regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series of Russian\\nfolksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means of Mrs.\\nInglethorp\\'s correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be abandoned.\\n\\nJust before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new\\ndisappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.\\n\\n\"Gone to London again?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster. \\'To see a\\nyoung lady\\'s dispensary,\\' he said.\"\\n\\n\"Silly ass!\" I ejaculated. \"I told him Wednesday was the one day she\\nwasn\\'t there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will you?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, monsieur.\"\\n\\nBut, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting angry. He\\nwas really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.\\n\\nAfter lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to\\nsee him.\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and\\nexcited in his manner roused my curiosity.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" I asked. \"I could go if there\\'s anything special.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s nothing much, but--well, if you are going, will you tell him--\"\\nhe dropped his voice to a whisper--\"I think I\\'ve found the extra\\ncoffee-cup!\"\\n\\nI had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot\\'s, but now my\\ncuriosity was aroused afresh.\\n\\nLawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my\\nhigh horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.\\n\\nThis time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within. Would\\nI mount? I mounted accordingly.\\n\\nPoirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He sprang\\nup at my entrance.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" I asked solicitously. \"You are not ill, I trust?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.\"\\n\\n\"Whether to catch the criminal or not?\" I asked facetiously.\\n\\nBut, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.\\n\\n\"\\'To speak or not to speak,\\' as your so great Shakespeare says, \\'that is\\nthe question.\\'\"\\n\\nI did not trouble to correct the quotation.\\n\\n\"You are not serious, Poirot?\"\\n\\n\"I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in\\nthe balance.\"\\n\\n\"And that is?\"\\n\\n\"A woman\\'s happiness, _mon ami_,\" he said gravely.\\n\\nI did not quite know what to say.\\n\\n\"The moment has come,\" said Poirot thoughtfully, \"and I do not know what\\nto do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one but I,\\nHercule Poirot, would attempt it!\" And he tapped himself proudly on the\\nbreast.\\n\\nAfter pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his effect,\\nI gave him Lawrence\\'s message.\\n\\n\"Aha!\" he cried. \"So he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good.\\nHe has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur\\nLawrence of yours!\"\\n\\nI did not myself think very highly of Lawrence\\'s intelligence; but\\nI forebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task for\\nforgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia\\'s days off.\\n\\n\"It is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young\\nlady was most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me\\neverything in the kindest way.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well, that\\'s all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia\\nanother day.\"\\n\\nI told him about the letter.\\n\\n\"I am sorry for that,\" he said. \"I always had hopes of that letter. But\\nno, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.\"\\nHe tapped his forehead. \"These little grey cells. It is \\'up to them\\'--as\\nyou say over here.\" Then, suddenly, he asked: \"Are you a judge of\\nfinger-marks, my friend?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I said, rather surprised, \"I know that there are no two\\nfinger-marks alike, but that\\'s as far as my science goes.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly.\"\\n\\nHe unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he laid\\non the table.\\n\\n\"I have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?\"\\n\\nI studied the proofs attentively.\\n\\n\"All greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man\\'s\\nfinger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady\\'s; they are much\\nsmaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3\"--I paused for some\\ntime--\"there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here, very\\ndistinctly, are No. 1\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Overlapping the others?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"You recognize them beyond fail?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; they are identical.\"\\n\\nPoirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up\\nagain.\\n\\n\"I suppose,\" I said, \"that as usual, you are not going to explain?\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence. No.\\n2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important. I merely\\nobtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little more complicated.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\n\"It is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a sort of\\nblur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you\\nthe special apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used. It is a\\nwell-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a\\nphotograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of\\ntime. Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks--it remains to\\ntell you the particular object on which they had been left.\"\\n\\n\"Go on--I am really excited.\"\\n\\n\"_Eh bien!_ Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a\\ntiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red\\nCross Hospital at Tadminster--which sounds like the house that Jack\\nbuilt!\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" I exclaimed. \"But what were Lawrence Cavendish\\'s\\nfinger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard the day\\nwe were there!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, he did!\"\\n\\n\"Impossible! We were all together the whole time.\"\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n\"No, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together. There\\nwas a moment when you could not have been all together, or it would not\\nhave been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and join you on\\nthe balcony.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d forgotten that,\" I admitted. \"But it was only for a moment.\"\\n\\n\"Long enough.\"\\n\\n\"Long enough for what?\"\\n\\nPoirot\\'s smile became rather enigmatical.\\n\\n\"Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a\\nvery natural interest and curiosity.\"\\n\\nOur eyes met. Poirot\\'s were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a\\nlittle tune. I watched him suspiciously.\\n\\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"what was in this particular little bottle?\"\\n\\nPoirot looked out of the window.\\n\\n\"Hydro-chloride of strychnine,\" he said, over his shoulder, continuing\\nto hum.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I had\\nexpected that answer.\\n\\n\"They use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little--only\\noccasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine\\nHydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the finger-marks\\nhave remained undisturbed since then.\"\\n\\n\"How did you manage to take this photograph?\"\\n\\n\"I dropped my hat from the balcony,\" explained Poirot simply. \"Visitors\\nwere not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many\\napologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia\\'s colleague had to go down and fetch it\\nfor me.\"\\n\\n\"Then you knew what you were going to find?\"\\n\\n\"No, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your\\nstory, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The\\npossibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.\"\\n\\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"your gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very\\nimportant discovery.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know,\" said Poirot. \"But one thing does strike me. No doubt it\\nhas struck you too.\"\\n\\n\"What is that?\"\\n\\n\"Why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case. This\\nis the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in Mrs.\\nInglethorp\\'s tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the counter at\\nStyles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine, handled by one\\nof the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I do not like\\nconfusion.\"\\n\\nBefore I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door and\\nstuck his head in.\\n\\n\"There is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.\"\\n\\n\"A lady?\"\\n\\nI jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. Mary Cavendish\\nwas standing in the doorway.\\n\\n\"I have been visiting an old woman in the village,\" she explained, \"and\\nas Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would call\\nfor you.\"\\n\\n\"Alas, madame,\" said Poirot, \"I thought you had come to honour me with a\\nvisit!\"\\n\\n\"I will some day, if you ask me,\" she promised him, smiling.\\n\\n\"That is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame\"--she\\nstarted ever so slightly--\"remember, Papa Poirot is always at your\\nservice.\"\\n\\nShe stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some\\ndeeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly away.\\n\\n\"Come, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?\"\\n\\n\"Enchanted, madame.\"\\n\\nAll the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me\\nthat in some way she was nervous of Poirot\\'s eyes.\\n\\nThe weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its\\nshrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports\\ncoat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like some\\ngreat giant sighing.\\n\\nWe walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge came\\nto us that something was wrong.\\n\\nDorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her\\nhands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the background,\\nall eyes and ears.\\n\\n\"Oh, m\\'am! Oh, m\\'am! I don\\'t know how to tell you--\"\\n\\n\"What is it, Dorcas?\" I asked impatiently. \"Tell us at once.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s those wicked detectives. They\\'ve arrested him--they\\'ve arrested\\nMr. Cavendish!\"\\n\\n\"Arrested Lawrence?\" I gasped.\\n\\nI saw a strange look come into Dorcas\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"No, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence--Mr. John.\"\\n\\nBehind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, and\\nas I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in Poirot\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI. THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION\\n\\nThe trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place\\ntwo months later.\\n\\nOf the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and\\nsympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself\\npassionately on her husband\\'s side, scorning the mere idea of his guilt,\\nand fought for him tooth and nail.\\n\\nI expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"Yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It\\nbrings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her\\njealousy have--\"\\n\\n\"Jealousy?\" I queried.\\n\\n\"Yes. Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As\\nI was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks\\nof nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over\\nhim.\"\\n\\nHe spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him earnestly, remembering that\\nlast afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to speak.\\nWith his tenderness for \"a woman\\'s happiness,\" I felt glad that the\\ndecision had been taken out of his hands.\\n\\n\"Even now,\" I said, \"I can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very\\nlast minute, I thought it was Lawrence!\"\\n\\nPoirot grinned.\\n\\n\"I know you did.\"\\n\\n\"But John! My old friend John!\"\\n\\n\"Every murderer is probably somebody\\'s old friend,\" observed Poirot\\nphilosophically. \"You cannot mix up sentiment and reason.\"\\n\\n\"I must say I think you might have given me a hint.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, _mon ami_, I did not do so, just because he _was_ your old\\nfriend.\"\\n\\nI was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed\\non to John what I believed to be Poirot\\'s views concerning Bauerstein.\\nHe, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.\\nNevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and\\nthe charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings were\\npretty well clipped for the future.\\n\\nI asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my intense\\nsurprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely likely to\\nbe acquitted.\\n\\n\"But, Poirot--\" I protested.\\n\\n\"Oh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs.\\nIt is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another matter\\nto prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little evidence.\\nThat is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I lack the last\\nlink in my chain. And unless I can find that missing link--\" He shook\\nhis head gravely.\\n\\n\"When did you first suspect John Cavendish?\" I asked, after a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\n\"Did you not suspect him at all?\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed.\"\\n\\n\"Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs.\\nCavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness at\\nthe inquest?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not\\nAlfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife--and you remember,\\nhe strenuously denied it at the inquest--it must be either Lawrence\\nor John. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish\\'s conduct was just as\\ninexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing\\nwas explained quite naturally.\"\\n\\n\"So,\" I cried, a light breaking in upon me, \"it was John who quarrelled\\nwith his mother that afternoon?\"\\n\\n\"Exactly.\"\\n\\n\"And you have known this all along?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. Mrs. Cavendish\\'s behaviour could only be explained that\\nway.\"\\n\\n\"And yet you say he may be acquitted?\"\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\"Certainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the case\\nfor the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will advise\\nhim to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the trial.\\nAnd--ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my friend. I\\nmust not appear in the case.\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"No. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that\\nlast link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish\\nmust think I am working for her husband, not against him.\"\\n\\n\"I say, that\\'s playing it a bit low down,\" I protested.\\n\\n\"Not at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,\\nand we must use any means in our power--otherwise he will slip\\nthrough our fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the\\nbackground. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will\\ntake all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at all\"--he\\nsmiled broadly--\"it will probably be as a witness for the defence.\"\\n\\nI could hardly believe my ears.\\n\\n\"It is quite _en règle_,\" continued Poirot. \"Strangely enough, I can\\ngive evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.\"\\n\\n\"Which one?\"\\n\\n\"The one that relates to the destruction of the will. John Cavendish did\\nnot destroy that will.\"\\n\\nPoirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police\\ncourt proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will\\nmerely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was\\nduly committed for trial.\\n\\nSeptember found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington,\\nPoirot being included in the family party.\\n\\nI myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see them\\ncontinually.\\n\\nAs the weeks went by, the state of Poirot\\'s nerves grew worse and worse.\\nThat \"last link\" he talked about was still lacking. Privately, I hoped\\nit might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary, if John\\nwere not acquitted?\\n\\nOn September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old Bailey,\\ncharged with \"The Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,\" and pleaded\\n\"Not Guilty.\"\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K. C., had been engaged to defend\\nhim.\\n\\nMr. Philips, K. C., opened the case for the Crown.\\n\\nThe murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It\\nwas neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and\\ntrusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.\\nEver since his boyhood, she had supported him. He and his wife had lived\\nat Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and attention.\\nShe had been their kind and generous benefactress.\\n\\nHe proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate and\\nspendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had also\\nbeen carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a neighbouring\\nfarmer\\'s wife. This having come to his stepmother\\'s ears, she taxed him\\nwith it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel ensued, part\\nof which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner had purchased\\nstrychnine at the village chemist\\'s shop, wearing a disguise by means of\\nwhich he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon another man--to wit,\\nMrs. Inglethorp\\'s husband, of whom he had been bitterly jealous. Luckily\\nfor Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to produce an unimpeachable alibi.\\n\\nOn the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the\\nquarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was\\nfound destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but\\nevidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in\\nfavour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his\\nfavour before her marriage, but--and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive\\nforefinger--the prisoner was not aware of that. What had induced the\\ndeceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could\\nnot say. She was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the\\nformer one; or--this seemed to him more likely--she may have had an idea\\nthat it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some conversation\\non the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in legal\\nknowledge. She had, about a year before, executed a will in favour of\\nthe prisoner. He would call evidence to show that it was the prisoner\\nwho ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal night.\\nLater in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on which\\noccasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the will\\nwhich, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour valid.\\n\\nThe prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his\\nroom, by Detective Inspector Japp--a most brilliant officer--of the\\nidentical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village\\nchemist\\'s to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder.\\nIt would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts\\nconstituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner\\'s guilt.\\n\\nAnd, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite\\nunthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.\\n\\nThe first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been\\ncalled at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the\\nunscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two\\nquestions.\\n\\n\"I take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.\"\\n\\nMr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by\\nhim to \"Mr. Inglethorp.\" Pressed, he admitted that he only knew Mr.\\nInglethorp by sight. He had never spoken to him. The witness was not\\ncross-examined.\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison. He\\nalso denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses testified\\nto the accuracy of these statements.\\n\\nThe gardeners\\' evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken, and\\nthen Dorcas was called.\\n\\nDorcas, faithful to her \"young gentlemen,\" denied strenuously that it\\ncould have been John\\'s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in\\nthe teeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the\\nboudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the\\nface of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her\\ngallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to deny\\nthis point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to give\\nevidence against her husband.\\n\\nAfter various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked:\\n\\n\"In the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr.\\nLawrence Cavendish from Parkson\\'s?\"\\n\\nDorcas shook her head.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr. Lawrence was away from\\nhome part of June.\"\\n\\n\"In the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what\\nwould be done with it?\"\\n\\n\"It would either be put in his room or sent on after him.\"\\n\\n\"By you?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard\\nwho would attend to anything like that.\"\\n\\nEvelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was\\nquestioned as to the parcel.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t remember. Lots of parcels come. Can\\'t remember one special one.\"\\n\\n\"You do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales,\\nor whether it was put in his room?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t think it was sent after him. Should have remembered it if it\\nwas.\"\\n\\n\"Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and\\nafterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?\"\\n\\n\"No, don\\'t think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.\"\\n\\n\"I believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown\\npaper?\" He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined\\nin the morning-room at Styles.\\n\\n\"Yes, I did.\"\\n\\n\"How did you come to look for it?\"\\n\\n\"The Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search\\nfor it.\"\\n\\n\"Where did you eventually discover it?\"\\n\\n\"On the top of--of--a wardrobe.\"\\n\\n\"On top of the prisoner\\'s wardrobe?\"\\n\\n\"I--I believe so.\"\\n\\n\"Did you not find it yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Then you must know where you found it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it was on the prisoner\\'s wardrobe.\"\\n\\n\"That is better.\"\\n\\nAn assistant from Parkson\\'s, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that\\non June 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as\\nrequested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.\\nNo, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in their\\nbooks. They had sent the beard, as directed, to \"L. Cavendish, Esq.,\\nStyles Court.\"\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously.\\n\\n\"Where was the letter written from?\"\\n\\n\"From Styles Court.\"\\n\\n\"The same address to which you sent the parcel?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"And the letter came from there?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nLike a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him:\\n\\n\"How do you know?\"\\n\\n\"I--I don\\'t understand.\"\\n\\n\"How do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the\\npostmark?\"\\n\\n\"No--but--\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you did _not_ notice the postmark! And yet you affirm so\\nconfidently that it came from Styles. It might, in fact, have been any\\npostmark?\"\\n\\n\"Y--es.\"\\n\\n\"In fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have\\nbeen posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance?\"\\n\\nThe witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest\\nsignified that he was satisfied.\\n\\nElizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had\\ngone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead\\nof leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had\\naccordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a slight\\nnoise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and had seen\\nMr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s door.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful\\nbullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down\\nagain with a satisfied smile on his face.\\n\\nWith the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and as\\nto seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the proceedings\\nwere adjourned until the following day.\\n\\nAs we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting\\ncounsel.\\n\\n\"That hateful man! What a net he has drawn around my poor John! How he\\ntwisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn\\'t!\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" I said consolingly, \"it will be the other way about to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. \"Mr.\\nHastings, you do not think--surely it could not have been Lawrence--Oh,\\nno, that could not be!\"\\n\\nBut I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I asked\\nhim what he thought Sir Ernest was driving at.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Poirot appreciatively. \"He is a clever man, that Sir Ernest.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think he believes Lawrence guilty?\"\\n\\n\"I do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying\\nfor is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are\\ndivided in their opinion as to which brother did it. He is endeavouring\\nto make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as\\nagainst John--and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.\"\\n\\nDetective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial was\\nreopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. After relating\\nthe earlier events, he proceeded:\\n\\n\"Acting on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself\\nsearched the prisoner\\'s room, during his temporary absence from the\\nhouse. In his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we\\nfound: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by\\nMr. Inglethorp\"--these were exhibited--\"secondly, this phial.\"\\n\\nThe phial was that already recognized by the chemist\\'s assistant, a tiny\\nbottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white crystalline\\npowder, and labelled: \"Strychnine Hydrochloride. POISON.\"\\n\\nA fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police\\ncourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It had\\nbeen found in Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s cheque book, and on being reversed at\\na mirror, showed clearly the words: \". . . erything of which I die\\npossessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...\" This placed\\nbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of\\nthe deceased lady\\'s husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment\\nof paper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the\\nbeard in the attic, completed his evidence.\\n\\nBut Sir Ernest\\'s cross-examination was yet to come.\\n\\n\"What day was it when you searched the prisoner\\'s room?\"\\n\\n\"Tuesday, the 24th of July.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly a week after the tragedy?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"You found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. Was the\\ndrawer unlocked?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a\\ncrime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone to\\nfind?\"\\n\\n\"He might have stowed them there in a hurry.\"\\n\\n\"But you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. He would\\nhave had ample time to remove them and destroy them.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"There is no perhaps about it. Would he, or would he not have had plenty\\nof time to remove and destroy them?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy\\nor light?\"\\n\\n\"Heavyish.\"\\n\\n\"In other words, it was winter underclothing. Obviously, the prisoner\\nwould not be likely to go to that drawer?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps not.\"\\n\\n\"Kindly answer my question. Would the prisoner, in the hottest week of a\\nhot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter underclothing.\\nYes, or no?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"In that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might\\nhave been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite\\nunaware of their presence?\"\\n\\n\"I should not think it likely.\"\\n\\n\"But it is possible?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"That is all.\"\\n\\nMore evidence followed. Evidence as to the financial difficulties in\\nwhich the prisoner had found himself at the end of July. Evidence as\\nto his intrigue with Mrs. Raikes--poor Mary, that must have been bitter\\nhearing for a woman of her pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her\\nfacts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to\\njump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.\\n\\nLawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer\\nto Mr. Philips\\' questions, he denied having ordered anything from\\nParkson\\'s in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in\\nWales.\\n\\nInstantly, Sir Ernest\\'s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.\\n\\n\"You deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson\\'s on June 29th?\"\\n\\n\"I do.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will\\ninherit Styles Court?\"\\n\\nThe brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrence\\'s pale face.\\nThe judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the\\nprisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.\\n\\nHeavywether cared nothing for his client\\'s anger.\\n\\n\"Answer my question, if you please.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose,\" said Lawrence quietly, \"that I should.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean by you \\'suppose\\'? Your brother has no children. You\\n_would_ inherit it, wouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that\\'s better,\" said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. \"And\\nyou\\'d inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Really, Sir Ernest,\" protested the judge, \"these questions are not\\nrelevant.\"\\n\\nSir Ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.\\n\\n\"On Tuesday, the 17th July, you went, I believe, with another guest, to\\nvisit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Did you--while you happened to be alone for a few seconds--unlock the\\npoison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?\"\\n\\n\"I--I--may have done so.\"\\n\\n\"I put it to you that you did do so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nSir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him.\\n\\n\"Did you examine one bottle in particular?\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not think so.\"\\n\\n\"Be careful, Mr. Cavendish. I am referring to a little bottle of\\nHydro-chloride of Strychnine.\"\\n\\nLawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.\\n\\n\"N--o--I am sure I didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\\nimpress of your finger-prints on it?\"\\n\\nThe bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.\\n\\n\"I--I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose so too! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\\n\"Then why did you take it up?\"\\n\\n\"I once studied to be a doctor. Such things naturally interest me.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! So poisons \\'naturally interest\\' you, do they? Still, you waited to\\nbe alone before gratifying that \\'interest\\' of yours?\"\\n\\n\"That was pure chance. If the others had been there, I should have done\\njust the same.\"\\n\\n\"Still, as it happens, the others were not there?\"\\n\\n\"No, but----\"\\n\\n\"In fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple\\nof minutes, and it happened--I say, it happened--to be during those two\\nminutes that you displayed your \\'natural interest\\' in Hydro-chloride of\\nStrychnine?\"\\n\\nLawrence stammered pitiably.\\n\\n\"I--I----\"\\n\\nWith a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed:\\n\\n\"I have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.\"\\n\\nThis bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The\\nheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\\ntogether, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\\nthreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate silence.\\n\\nThere was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called\\nupon for their opinion of the signature of \"Alfred Inglethorp\" in the\\nchemist\\'s poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was\\ncertainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might\\nbe that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that it\\nmight be the prisoner\\'s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether\\'s speech in opening the case for the defence\\nwas not a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\\nmanner. Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he\\nknown a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it\\nentirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically\\nunproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\\nimpartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the prisoner\\'s\\nroom. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed out, and he\\nsubmitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was the prisoner\\nwho had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a wicked and\\nmalicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix the crime\\non the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a shred of\\nevidence in support of their contention that it was the prisoner who\\nordered the black beard from Parkson\\'s. The quarrel which had taken\\nplace between prisoner and his stepmother was freely admitted, but both\\nit and his financial embarrassments had been grossly exaggerated.\\n\\nHis learned friend--Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips--had\\nstated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have\\ncome forward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not Mr.\\nInglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He thought the\\nfacts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this.\\nThe prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been\\nauthoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr.\\nand Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisoner\\'s head\\nthat anyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr.\\nInglethorp. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\\nquarrels.\\n\\nThe prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had\\nentered the chemist\\'s shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp.\\nThe prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called\\nMarston\\'s Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,\\ncouched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain matters\\nto his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner had,\\naccordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there vainly\\nfor half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met with no\\none on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of his story,\\nbut luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced as evidence.\\n\\nAs for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the\\nprisoner had formerly practiced at the Bar, and was perfectly well aware\\nthat the will made in his favour a year before was automatically revoked\\nby his stepmother\\'s remarriage. He would call evidence to show who did\\ndestroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up quite a\\nnew view of the case.\\n\\nFinally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\\nother people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to\\nthe fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as\\nstrong, if not stronger than that against his brother.\\n\\nHe would now call the prisoner.\\n\\nJohn acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernest\\'s\\nskilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. The anonymous note\\nreceived by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine. The\\nreadiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and the\\ndisagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.\\n\\nAt the close of his examination, he paused, and said:\\n\\n\"I should like to make one thing clear. I utterly reject and disapprove\\nof Sir Ernest Heavywether\\'s insinuations against my brother. My brother,\\nI am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.\"\\n\\nSir Ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that John\\'s protest\\nhad produced a very favourable impression on the jury.\\n\\nThen the cross-examination began.\\n\\n\"I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\\nwitnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\\nthat of Mr. Inglethorp. Is not that very surprising?\"\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t think so. I was told there had been a quarrel between my\\nmother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was not\\nreally the case.\"\\n\\n\"Not when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\\nconversation--fragments which you must have recognized?\"\\n\\n\"I did not recognize them.\"\\n\\n\"Your memory must be unusually short!\"\\n\\n\"No, but we were both angry, and, I think, said more than we meant. I\\npaid very little attention to my mother\\'s actual words.\"\\n\\nMr. Philips\\' incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He\\npassed on to the subject of the note.\\n\\n\"You have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there nothing\\nfamiliar about the hand-writing of it?\"\\n\\n\"Not that I know of.\"\\n\\n\"Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\\nhand-writing--carelessly disguised?\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not think so.\"\\n\\n\"I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"I put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the idea\\nof a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this note\\nyourself in order to bear out your statement!\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting about\\nat a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the chemist\\'s\\nshop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in the name of\\nAlfred Inglethorp?\"\\n\\n\"No, that is a lie.\"\\n\\n\"I put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp\\'s clothes, with\\na black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there--and signed the\\nregister in his name!\"\\n\\n\"That is absolutely untrue.\"\\n\\n\"Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between\\nthe note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the jury,\"\\nsaid Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has done his\\nduty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate perjury.\\n\\nAfter this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday.\\n\\nPoirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He had that\\nlittle frown between the eyes that I knew so well.\\n\\n\"What is it, Poirot?\" I inquired.\\n\\n\"Ah, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.\"\\n\\nIn spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. Evidently there was\\na likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.\\n\\nWhen we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Mary\\'s offer of\\ntea.\\n\\n\"No, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room.\"\\n\\nI followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out\\na small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table,\\nand, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!\\n\\nMy jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:\\n\\n\"No, _mon ami_, I am not in my second childhood! I steady my nerves,\\nthat is all. This employment requires precision of the fingers. With\\nprecision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I\\nneeded that more than now!\"\\n\\n\"What is the trouble?\" I asked.\\n\\nWith a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his carefully built\\nup edifice.\\n\\n\"It is this, _mon ami!_ That I can build card houses seven stories high,\\nbut I cannot\"--thump--\"find\"--thump--\"that last link of which I spoke to\\nyou.\"\\n\\nI could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began\\nslowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.\\n\\n\"It is done--so! By placing--one card--on another--with\\nmathematical--precision!\"\\n\\nI watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. He\\nnever hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring\\ntrick.\\n\\n\"What a steady hand you\\'ve got,\" I remarked. \"I believe I\\'ve only seen\\nyour hand shake once.\"\\n\\n\"On an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,\" observed Poirot,\\nwith great placidity.\\n\\n\"Yes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when\\nyou discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s\\nbedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantel-piece, twiddling the\\nthings on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I\\nmust say----\"\\n\\nBut I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\\ncry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands\\nover his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the\\nkeenest agony.\\n\\n\"Good heavens, Poirot!\" I cried. \"What is the matter? Are you taken\\nill?\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" he gasped. \"It is--it is--that I have an idea!\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" I exclaimed, much relieved. \"One of your \\'little ideas\\'?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, _ma foi_, no!\" replied Poirot frankly. \"This time it is an idea\\ngigantic! Stupendous! And you--_you_, my friend, have given it to me!\"\\n\\nSuddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,\\nand before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.\\n\\nMary Cavendish entered at that moment.\\n\\n\"What is the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He rushed past me crying out:\\n\\'A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!\\' And,\\nbefore I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.\"\\n\\nI hurried to the window. True enough, there he was, tearing down the\\nstreet, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. I turned to Mary with a\\ngesture of despair.\\n\\n\"He\\'ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes, round\\nthe corner!\"\\n\\nOur eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.\\n\\n\"What can be the matter?\"\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he had\\nan idea, and rushed off as you saw.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mary, \"I expect he will be back before dinner.\"\\n\\nBut night fell, and Poirot had not returned.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII. THE LAST LINK\\n\\nPOIROT\\'S abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning\\nwore away, and still he did not reappear. But about three o\\'clock a\\nferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see\\nPoirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The\\nlittle man was transformed. He radiated an absurd complacency. He bowed\\nwith exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.\\n\\n\"Madame, I have your permission to hold a little _réunion_ in the\\n_salon_? It is necessary for every one to attend.\"\\n\\nMary smiled sadly.\\n\\n\"You know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every way.\"\\n\\n\"You are too amiable, madame.\"\\n\\nStill beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing\\nforward chairs as he did so.\\n\\n\"Miss Howard--here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good\\nDorcas. And Annie. _Bien!_ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes\\nuntil Mr. Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him a note.\"\\n\\nMiss Howard rose immediately from her seat.\\n\\n\"If that man comes into the house, I leave it!\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.\\n\\nFinally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair. A few minutes\\nlater Alfred Inglethorp entered the room.\\n\\nThe company once assembled, Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\\npopular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.\\n\\n\"_Messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur\\nJohn Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom\\nof the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept\\nlocked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\\noccurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain\\non the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of\\nbromide powders.\\n\\n\"To take the fragment of green material first, I found it caught in the\\nbolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\\noccupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia. I handed the fragment over to\\nthe police who did not consider it of much importance. Nor did they\\nrecognize it for what it was--a piece torn from a green land armlet.\"\\n\\nThere was a little stir of excitement.\\n\\n\"Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land--Mrs.\\nCavendish. Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered\\nthe deceased\\'s room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle\\nCynthia\\'s room.\"\\n\\n\"But that door was bolted on the inside!\" I cried.\\n\\n\"When I examined the room, yes. But in the first place we have only\\nher word for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and\\nreported it fastened. In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\\nopportunity to shoot the bolt across. I took an early opportunity\\nof verifying my conjectures. To begin with, the fragment corresponds\\nexactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish\\'s armlet. Also, at the inquest,\\nMrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\\nof the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that\\nstatement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of\\nthe building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish\\'s door. I myself, in company\\nwith the police, went to the deceased\\'s room, and whilst there I,\\napparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\\nthat, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.\\nThis confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth\\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\\nthe tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her\\nown room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased\\'s room when the\\nalarm was given.\"\\n\\nI shot a quick glance at Mary. She was very pale, but smiling.\\n\\n\"I proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her\\nmother-in-law\\'s room. We will say that she is seeking for something and\\nhas not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized\\nwith an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the bed\\ntable, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish, startled,\\ndrops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She picks it up,\\nand retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia\\'s room, closing the door\\nbehind her. She hurries out into the passage, for the servants must not\\nfind her where she is. But it is too late! Already footsteps are echoing\\nalong the gallery which connects the two wings. What can she do? Quick\\nas thought, she hurries back to the young girl\\'s room, and starts\\nshaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come trooping down the\\npassage. They are all busily battering at Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s door. It\\noccurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not arrived with the rest,\\nbut--and this is significant--I can find no one who saw her come from\\nthe other wing.\" He looked at Mary Cavendish. \"Am I right, madame?\"\\n\\nShe bowed her head.\\n\\n\"Quite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would do\\nmy husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so.\\nBut it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\\ninnocence.\"\\n\\n\"In a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many\\nmisconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true\\nsignificance.\"\\n\\n\"The will!\" cried Lawrence. \"Then it was you, Mary, who destroyed the\\nwill?\"\\n\\nShe shook her head, and Poirot shook his also.\\n\\n\"No,\" he said quietly. \"There is only one person who could possibly have\\ndestroyed that will--Mrs. Inglethorp herself!\"\\n\\n\"Impossible!\" I exclaimed. \"She had only made it out that very\\nafternoon!\"\\n\\n\"Nevertheless, _mon ami_, it was Mrs. Inglethorp. Because, in no other\\nway can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of the\\nyear, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.\"\\n\\nI gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\\nbeing incongruous! Poirot was continuing:\\n\\n\"The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\\nYet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy\\nsomething, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in\\nconsequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper was\\nthrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick document\\nsuch as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in Mrs.\\nInglethorp\\'s room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to destroy\\nsome important document--possibly a will. So the discovery of the\\ncharred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of\\ncourse, know at the time that the will in question had only been made\\nthis afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell\\ninto a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s\\ndetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\\nquarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took\\nplace after, and not before the making of the will.\\n\\n\"Here, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea.\\nI faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at 4 o\\'clock, Dorcas\\noverheard her mistress saying angrily: \\'You need not think that any\\nfear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\"\\nI conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were addressed,\\nnot to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At 5 o\\'clock, an hour\\nlater, she uses almost the same words, but the standpoint is different.\\nShe admits to Dorcas, \\'I don\\'t know what to do; scandal between husband\\nand wife is a dreadful thing.\\' At 4 o\\'clock she has been angry, but\\ncompletely mistress of herself. At 5 o\\'clock she is in violent distress,\\nand speaks of having had a great shock.\\n\\n\"Looking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I\\nwas convinced was correct. The second \\'scandal\\' she spoke of was not the\\nsame as the first--and it concerned herself!\\n\\n\"Let us reconstruct. At 4 o\\'clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with\\nher son, and threatens to denounce him to his wife--who, by the\\nway, overheard the greater part of the conversation. At 4.30, Mrs.\\nInglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,\\nmakes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.\\nAt 5 o\\'clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\\nagitation, with a slip of paper--\\'a letter,\\' Dorcas thinks--in her\\nhand, and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.\\nPresumably, then, between 4.30 and 5 o\\'clock, something has occurred to\\noccasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now as anxious\\nto destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was that\\nsomething?\\n\\n\"As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody\\nentered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change of\\nsentiment?\\n\\n\"One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs.\\nInglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she\\nasked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room\\nstood her husband\\'s desk--locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,\\nand, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk.\\nThat one of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in\\nsearching for the stamps she came across something else--that slip of\\npaper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\\nfor Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed\\nthat the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously\\nwas a written proof of her own husband\\'s infidelity. She demanded it\\nfrom Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing\\nto do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is\\na very resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\\njealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all\\ncosts, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to\\npick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s despatch-case, which had been\\nlost that morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all\\nimportant papers in this particular case.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven\\ndesperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening she\\nunbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia\\'s room. Possibly she\\napplied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened quite noiselessly\\nwhen I tried it. She put off her project until the early hours of the\\nmorning as being safer, since the servants were accustomed to hearing\\nher move about her room at that time. She dressed completely in her land\\nkit, and made her way quietly through Mademoiselle Cynthia\\'s room into\\nthat of Mrs. Inglethorp.\"\\n\\nHe paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted:\\n\\n\"But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?\"\\n\\n\"Not if you were drugged, mademoiselle.\"\\n\\n\"Drugged?\"\\n\\n\"_Mais, oui!_\"\\n\\n\"You remember\"--he addressed us collectively again--\"that through all\\nthe tumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept. That admitted\\nof two possibilities. Either her sleep was feigned--which I did not\\nbelieve--or her unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means.\\n\\n\"With this latter idea in my mind, I examined all the coffee-cups\\nmost carefully, remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought\\nMademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before. I took a sample from\\neach cup, and had them analysed--with no result. I had counted the cups\\ncarefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had\\ntaken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself\\nmistaken.\\n\\n\"Then I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight.\\nCoffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr.\\nBauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the\\nwhole affair, for there was now one cup missing. The servants noticed\\nnothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought\\nin seven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas\\nDorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as\\nusual--or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one\\nfound broken in Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s room.\\n\\n\"I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.\\nI had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\\ncups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in\\nher coffee. My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about\\nsome \\'salt\\' on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs.\\nInglethorp\\'s room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and\\nsent it to be analysed.\"\\n\\n\"But that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,\" said Lawrence\\nquickly.\\n\\n\"Not exactly. The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\\nwas, or was not, present. He did not have it tested, as I did, for a\\nnarcotic.\"\\n\\n\"For a narcotic?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Here is the analyst\\'s report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a\\nsafe, but effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle\\nCynthia. And it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d\\'heure_ in\\nconsequence! Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly\\ntaken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word \\'Poison\\'!\\nShe has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\\nperfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\\nshe must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s death lay at her door. She\\nis seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\\nand quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle Cynthia\\ninto a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by Monsieur\\nLawrence. The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too many eyes\\nare upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is mentioned, and she\\ndiscovers that after all the tragedy is not her doing.\\n\\n\"We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\\nbeing so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with\\nstrychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.\"\\n\\nPoirot paused. Mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her\\nface.\\n\\n\"All you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most\\nawful hour of my life. I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful. I\\nunderstand now----\"\\n\\n\"What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa\\nPoirot, eh? But you would not trust me.\"\\n\\n\"I see everything now,\" said Lawrence. \"The drugged cocoa, taken on top\\nof the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a\\nlittle difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" The cry of surprise was universal.\\n\\n\"No. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.\\nInglethorp\\'s room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It\\nwas still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in\\nthe nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had\\nhappened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my\\nlittle case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up, had\\ndeposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. In exactly\\nthe same way, Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee on\\nreaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had played\\nher the same trick.\\n\\n\"What happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say that\\nMrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the table by\\nthe bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she heated up\\nher cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced with a new\\nproblem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The coffee was never\\ndrunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered between seven\\nand nine o\\'clock that evening. What third medium was there--a medium so\\nsuitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that it is extraordinary\\nno one has thought of it?\" Poirot looked round the room, and then\\nanswered himself impressively. \"Her medicine!\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\\ntonic?\" I cried.\\n\\n\"There was no need to introduce it. It was already there--in the\\nmixture. The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical\\nstrychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins. To make that clear to you, I\\nwill read you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the\\nDispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster:\\n\\n\"\\'The following prescription has become famous in text books:\\n\\n  Strychninae Sulph. . . . . .   gr.I\\n  Potass Bromide . . . . . . .   3vi\\n  Aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . .   3viii\\n  Fiat Mistura\\n\\nThis solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the strychnine\\nsalt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady in England\\nlost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated strychnine\\ncollected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she swallowed\\nnearly all of it!\"\\n\\n\"Now there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins\\' prescription, but\\nyou will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders.\\nOne or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\\nwould effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,\\nand cause it to be taken in the last dose. You will learn later that\\nthe person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s medicine was always\\nextremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at\\nthe bottom of it undisturbed.\\n\\n\"Throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was\\nintended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s\\nbell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening Mademoiselle Cynthia was\\nspending the night with friends, so that Mrs. Inglethorp would have\\nbeen quite alone in the right wing, completely shut off from help of any\\nkind, and would have died, in all probability, before medical aid could\\nhave been summoned. But in her hurry to be in time for the village\\nentertainment Mrs. Inglethorp forgot to take her medicine, and the next\\nday she lunched away from home, so that the last--and fatal--dose was\\nactually taken twenty-four hours later than had been anticipated by the\\nmurderer; and it is owing to that delay that the final proof--the last\\nlink of the chain--is now in my hands.\"\\n\\nAmid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.\\n\\n\"A letter in the murderer\\'s own hand-writing, mes amis! Had it been a\\nlittle clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp, warned\\nin time, would have escaped. As it was, she realized her danger, but not\\nthe manner of it.\"\\n\\nIn the deathly silence, Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,\\nclearing his throat, read:\\n\\n_\"\\'Dearest Evelyn:_\\n\\n\"_\\'You will be anxious at hearing nothing. It is all right--only it will\\nbe to-night instead of last night. You understand. There\\'s a good\\ntime coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. No one\\ncan possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours about the\\nbromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very circumspect. A\\nfalse step----\\'_\\n\\n\"Here, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was\\ninterrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. We all\\nknow this hand-writing and----\"\\n\\nA howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.\\n\\n\"You devil! How did you get it?\"\\n\\nA chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement on\\nhis part, and his assailant fell with a crash.\\n\\n\"_Messieurs, mesdames_,\" said Poirot, with a flourish, \"let me introduce\\nyou to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII. POIROT EXPLAINS\\n\\n\"Poirot, you old villain,\" I said, \"I\\'ve half a mind to strangle you!\\nWhat do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?\"\\n\\nWe were sitting in the library. Several hectic days lay behind us. In\\nthe room below, John and Mary were together once more, while Alfred\\nInglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I had Poirot to\\nmyself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.\\n\\nPoirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:\\n\\n\"I did not deceive you, _mon ami_. At most, I permitted you to deceive\\nyourself.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but why?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it is difficult to explain. You see, my friend, you have a nature\\nso honest, and a countenance so transparent, that--_enfin_, to conceal\\nyour feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas, the very first\\ntime you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman would have--in\\nyour so expressive idiom--\\'smelt a rat\\'! And then, _bonjour_ to our\\nchances of catching him!\"\\n\\n\"I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.\"\\n\\n\"My friend,\" besought Poirot, \"I implore you, do not enrage yourself!\\nYour help has been of the most invaluable. It is but the extremely\\nbeautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" I grumbled, a little mollified. \"I still think you might have\\ngiven me a hint.\"\\n\\n\"But I did, my friend. Several hints. You would not take them. Think\\nnow, did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty? Did\\nI not, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be\\nacquitted?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but----\"\\n\\n\"And did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\\nbringing the murderer to justice? Was it not plain to you that I was\\nspeaking of two entirely different persons?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I said, \"it was not plain to me!\"\\n\\n\"Then again,\" continued Poirot, \"at the beginning, did I not repeat to\\nyou several times that I didn\\'t want Mr. Inglethorp arrested _now_? That\\nshould have conveyed something to you.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s\\ndeath, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away\\nfrom that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no\\nidea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of\\nMr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\\nconnect him with it. When I arrived at the chateau, I realized at once\\nthat it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the\\nway, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on you\\nthe significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" I said impatiently. \"Go on.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp\\'s guilt were\\nvery much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him that\\nI was inclined to believe that he had not done it.\"\\n\\n\"When did you change your mind?\"\\n\\n\"When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the more\\nefforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that\\nInglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was\\nJohn Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.\"\\n\\n\"But why?\"\\n\\n\"Simply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\\nwith Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I\\ndiscovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who\\nwas attracted by the farmer\\'s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a\\ndifferent interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was\\nafraid of the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. This\\nattitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to\\nthe conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. _Eh\\nbien!_ from that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be\\narrested.\"\\n\\n\"Wait a minute. I don\\'t see why he wished to be arrested?\"\\n\\n\"Because, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once\\nacquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it was\\nclever--his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here, he knew\\nthat in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived the\\nexceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\\nagainst himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his\\nirreproachable alibi--and, hey presto, he was safe for life!\"\\n\\n\"But I still don\\'t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to\\nthe chemist\\'s shop?\"\\n\\nPoirot stared at me in surprise.\\n\\n\"Is it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was\\nMiss Howard who went to the chemist\\'s shop?\"\\n\\n\"Miss Howard?\"\\n\\n\"But, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a\\ngood height, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and\\nInglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between\\nthem, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself.\\nThey are a clever pair!\"\\n\\n\"I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\\ndone,\" I remarked.\\n\\n\"_Bon!_ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to\\nthink that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember\\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she dispensed\\nhis medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from one of the\\nmany books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was studying for her\\nexam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the addition of a\\nbromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause the precipitation\\nof the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite suddenly. Mrs.\\nInglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she occasionally took\\nat night. What could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of\\nthose powders in Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s large sized bottle of medicine when\\nit came from Coot\\'s? The risk is practically nil. The tragedy will not\\ntake place until nearly a fortnight later. If anyone has seen either of\\nthem touching the medicine, they will have forgotten it by that time.\\nMiss Howard will have engineered her quarrel, and departed from the\\nhouse. The lapse of time, and her absence, will defeat all suspicion.\\nYes, it was a clever idea! If they had left it alone, it is possible\\nthe crime might never have been brought home to them. But they were not\\nsatisfied. They tried to be too clever--and that was their undoing.\"\\n\\nPoirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\\n\\n\"They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying\\nstrychnine at the village chemist\\'s, and signing the register in his\\nhand-writing.\\n\\n\"On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On\\nMonday, therefore, at six o\\'clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be\\nseen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss\\nHoward has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs.\\nRaikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six o\\'clock,\\nMiss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the chemist\\'s shop,\\nwith her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and writes the name\\nof Alfred Inglethorp in John\\'s handwriting, which she had previously\\nstudied carefully.\\n\\n\"But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes\\nhim an anonymous note--still copying his hand-writing--which takes him\\nto a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\\nhim.\\n\\n\"So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred\\nInglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him\\nin any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which, after\\nall, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John Cavendish.\\n\\n\"But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine\\nthat night. The broken bell, Cynthia\\'s absence--arranged by Inglethorp\\nthrough his wife--all these are wasted. And then--he makes his slip.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,\\nwho, he fears, may be in a panic at the nonsuccess of their plan. It is\\nprobable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected. Caught\\nin the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his desk.\\nHe fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it again,\\nand that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before he could\\nsnatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little dreaming\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the incriminating\\ndocument.\\n\\n\"But this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and\\nbecomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though,\\nunfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\\nher mind. She knows that she is in danger--but is ignorant of where the\\ndanger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down\\nand writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she\\nalso determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just made.\\nShe keeps the fatal letter.\"\\n\\n\"It was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock\\nof the despatch-case?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he realized\\nits importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely nothing to\\nconnect him with the crime.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s only one thing I can\\'t make out, why didn\\'t he destroy it at\\nonce when he got hold of it?\"\\n\\n\"Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all--that of keeping\\nit on his own person.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand.\"\\n\\n\"Look at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there were\\nonly five short minutes in which he could have taken it--the five\\nminutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before\\nthat time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who\\npassed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He enters\\nthe room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys--they\\nwere all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-case--it is locked, and\\nthe keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it\\nmeans that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had hoped.\\nBut he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake of that\\ndamning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a penknife,\\nand turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking for.\\n\\n\"But now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper on\\nhim. He may be seen leaving the room--he may be searched. If the paper\\nis found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute, too, he\\nhears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the boudoir. He\\nmust act quickly. Where can he hide this terrible slip of paper? The\\ncontents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case, are sure to\\nbe examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he dare not keep\\nit. He looks round, and he sees--what do you think, _mon ami?_\"\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n\"In a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling\\nthem up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\\nspills in the vase on the mantle-piece.\"\\n\\nI uttered an exclamation.\\n\\n\"No one would think of looking there,\" Poirot continued. \"And he will\\nbe able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece of\\nevidence against him.\"\\n\\n\"Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp\\'s\\nbedroom, under our very noses?\" I cried.\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\"Yes, my friend. That is where I discovered my \\'last link,\\' and I owe\\nthat very fortunate discovery to you.\"\\n\\n\"To me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was\\nstraightening the ornaments on the mantel-piece?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I don\\'t see----\"\\n\\n\"No, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in\\nthe morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all\\nthe objects on the mantel-piece. And, if they were already straightened,\\nthere would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the\\nmeantime, someone else had touched them.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me,\" I murmured, \"so that is the explanation of your extraordinary\\nbehaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still there?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and it was a race for time.\"\\n\\n\"But I still can\\'t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to leave\\nit there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but he had no opportunity. I saw to that.\"\\n\\n\"You?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\\nconfidence on the subject?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then\\nif Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he\\nwould not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere, and\\nby enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually prevent\\nhis destroying it. He was already under suspicion, and by making the\\nmatter public I secured the services of about ten amateur detectives,\\nwho would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself aware of their\\nwatchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy the document. He\\nwas therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving it in the spill\\nvase.\"\\n\\n\"But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper\\'s existence. In\\naccordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred\\nInglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John\\nCavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\\nmeeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that\\nsooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too\\nclever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no\\none had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely\\nthey would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never\\nhave been able to bring him to justice.\"\\n\\n\"I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss\\nHoward?\"\\n\\n\"When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\\nletter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.\"\\n\\n\"Why, what was there to lie about?\"\\n\\n\"You saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--more or less.\"\\n\\n\"You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very distinctive\\nhand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if you look at\\nthe date at the top of the letter you will notice that \\'July 17th\\' is\\nquite different in this respect. Do you see what I mean?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I confessed, \"I don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on\\nthe 7th--the day after Miss Howard\\'s departure? The \\'1\\' was written in\\nbefore the \\'7\\' to turn it into the \\'17th\\'.\"\\n\\n\"But why?\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the\\nletter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because\\nshe did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at once\\na suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it was\\nwise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.\"\\n\\n\"And yet,\" I cried indignantly, \"after that, you gave me two reasons why\\nMiss Howard could not have committed the crime!\"\\n\\n\"And very good reasons too,\" replied Poirot. \"For a long time they were\\na stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact: that\\nshe and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have committed the\\ncrime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not debar her\\nfrom being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather over-vehement\\nhatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion. There was,\\nundoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he came to\\nStyles. They had already arranged their infamous plot--that he should\\nmarry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make a will\\nleaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very cleverly\\nconceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would probably\\nhave left England, and lived together on their poor victim\\'s money.\\n\\n\"They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to be\\ndirected against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a\\nvery different _dénouement_. She arrives from Middlingham with all the\\ncompromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her.\\nNo notice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the\\nstrychnine and glasses in John\\'s room. She puts the beard in the attic.\\nShe will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,\" I remarked.\\n\"It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime home to\\nLawrence.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out\\nof pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to the\\npair of schemers.\"\\n\\n\"His manner was unfortunate,\" I observed thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"Yes. You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"You did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of\\nthe crime?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I exclaimed, astonished. \"Impossible!\"\\n\\n\"Not at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my mind when I\\nasked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were\\nthe bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male\\nimpersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more\\nevidence against her than anyone else.\"\\n\\n\"You are joking, Poirot!\"\\n\\n\"No. Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when\\nhe first entered his mother\\'s room on the fatal night? It was because,\\nwhilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your\\nshoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia\\'s room was unbolted.\"\\n\\n\"But he declared that he saw it bolted!\" I cried.\\n\\n\"Exactly,\" said Poirot dryly. \"And that was just what confirmed my\\nsuspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.\"\\n\\n\"But why should he shield her?\"\\n\\n\"Because he is in love with her.\"\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n\"There, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that,\\nfar from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.\"\\n\\n\"Who told you that, _mon ami?_\"\\n\\n\"Cynthia herself.\"\\n\\n\"_La pauvre petite!_ And she was concerned?\"\\n\\n\"She said that she did not mind at all.\"\\n\\n\"Then she certainly did mind very much,\" remarked Poirot. \"They are like\\nthat--_les femmes!_\"\\n\\n\"What you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,\" I said.\\n\\n\"But why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour\\nface every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his brother?\\nHe had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia was in\\nlove with Monsieur John. When he entered his mother\\'s room, and saw\\nher obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that Mademoiselle\\nCynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly driven desperate.\\nFirst he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his feet, remembering\\nthat _she_ had gone up with his mother the night before, and he\\ndetermined that there should be no chance of testing its contents.\\nThenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld the theory of\\n\\'Death from natural causes\\'.\"\\n\\n\"And what about the \\'extra coffee-cup\\'?\"\\n\\n\"I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but\\nI had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant;\\nbut, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\\nextra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.\\nAnd he was perfectly right.\"\\n\\n\"One thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?\"\\n\\n\"They were, of course, an accusation against her husband.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me, Poirot,\" I said with a sigh, \"I think you have explained\\neverything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his\\nwife are reconciled.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks to me.\"\\n\\n\"How do you mean--thanks to you?\"\\n\\n\"My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\\ntrial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still\\nloved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was equally in love\\nwith him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a\\nmisunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a\\nsensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she\\ndid not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are both\\nunusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He drifted\\ninto an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately cultivated\\nthe friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of John\\nCavendish\\'s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big decision?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I quite understood your distress.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. I was\\ntrying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at once. I\\ncould have cleared him--though it might have meant a failure to convict\\nthe real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my real\\nattitude up to the very last moment--which partly accounts for my\\nsuccess.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being brought\\nto trial?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of \\'a woman\\'s\\nhappiness\\'. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\\ncould have brought these two proud souls together again.\"\\n\\nI looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the little\\nman! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for murder as\\na restorer of conjugal happiness!\\n\\n\"I perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,\" said Poirot, smiling at me. \"No\\none but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And you are\\nwrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the\\ngreatest thing in all the world.\"\\n\\nHis words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as she lay\\nwhite and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. There had come\\nthe sound of the bell below. She had started up. Poirot had opened the\\ndoor, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. \"Yes, madame,\"\\nhe said. \"I have brought him back to you.\" He had stood aside, and as\\nI went out I had seen the look in Mary\\'s eyes, as John Cavendish had\\ncaught his wife in his arms.\\n\\n\"Perhaps you are right, Poirot,\" I said gently. \"Yes, it is the greatest\\nthing in the world.\"\\n\\nSuddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped in.\\n\\n\"I--I only----\"\\n\\n\"Come in,\" I said, springing up.\\n\\nShe came in, but did not sit down.\\n\\n\"I--only wanted to tell you something----\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\nCynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly\\nexclaiming: \"You dears!\" kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed out\\nof the room again.\\n\\n\"What on earth does this mean?\" I asked, surprised.\\n\\nIt was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the\\nsalute rather impaired the pleasure.\\n\\n\"It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike her\\nas much as she thought,\" replied Poirot philosophically.\\n\\n\"But----\"\\n\\n\"Here he is.\"\\n\\nLawrence at that moment passed the door.\\n\\n\"Eh! Monsieur Lawrence,\" called Poirot. \"We must congratulate you, is it\\nnot so?\"\\n\\nLawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry\\nspectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming.\\n\\nI sighed.\\n\\n\"What is it, _mon ami?_\"\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" I said sadly. \"They are two delightful women!\"\\n\\n\"And neither of them is for you?\" finished Poirot. \"Never mind.\\nConsole yourself, my friend. We may hunt together again, who knows? And\\nthen----\"\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s The Mysterious Affair at Styles, by Agatha\\nChristie\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES\\n***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 863-8.txt or 863-8.zip ***** This and\\nall associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/8/6/863/\\n\\nProduced by Charles Keller, David Widger and Martin Witzenburg\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\\nrenamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\\nand without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain\\nfreely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To\\nlearn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and\\nhow your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the\\nFoundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.

Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing\\nthe number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array\\nof equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\\nthe IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\\nplease visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\\na copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
